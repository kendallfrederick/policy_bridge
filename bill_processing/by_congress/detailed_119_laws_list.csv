1,HR,119,One Big Beautiful Bill Act,https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/119/hr/1?format=xml,"<p>This act reduces taxes, reduces or increases spending for various federal programs, increases the statutory debt limit, and otherwise addresses agencies and programs throughout the federal government. &nbsp;</p><p>It is known as a reconciliation bill and includes legislation submitted by several congressional committees pursuant to provisions in the FY2025 congressional budget resolution (H Con. Res. 14) that directed the committees to submit legislation to the House or Senate Budget Committee that will increase or decrease the deficit and increase the statutory debt limit by specified amounts. (Reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)</p><p>TITLE I--COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY</p><p>This title addresses a wide range of Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including by changing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and extending programs authorized by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the 2018 farm bill).</p><p>Subtitle A--Nutrition</p><p>(Sec. 10101)&nbsp;This section prohibits USDA from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) based on a reevaluation of the contents of the TFP (i.e., the market basket of goods). Further, any annual adjustment to the cost of the plan must be based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.</p><p>As background, USDA created the TFP (the cost of purchasing a nutritionally adequate low-cost diet), which is used to determine maximum monthly benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). USDA calculates the cost of the TFP each year to account for food price inflation. Maximum allotments are set at the monthly cost of the TFP for a four-person family, adjusted for family size. Under a provision of the 2018 farm bill, USDA must reevaluate the market basket of goods every five years based on current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance.</p><p>(Sec. 10102) This section increases the work requirements for certain SNAP recipients&nbsp;who are able-bodied adults.</p><p>As background,&nbsp;SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) currently have work-related requirements in addition to the general SNAP work registration and employment and training requirements. SNAP law limits benefits to ABAWDs to 3 months out of a 36-month period, unless the participant meets the additional work-related requirements.</p><p>This section raises the age for those who must meet these additional work requirements to include adults who are 65 years old and younger, whereas these requirements currently apply to adults who are 55 years old and younger.</p><p>This section requires parents and household members to meet the additional work requirements (similar to someone who does not have a dependent child) if the child is age 14 and older. Currently, those with a child under the age of 18 are exempt from the requirements.</p><p>This section&nbsp;excludes from the additional work requirements SNAP recipients who are Indians, Urban Indians, or California Indians (as these terms are defined by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act).&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the section generally requires homeless individuals, veterans, and certain foster care individuals&nbsp;to meet these work requirements. Foster care individuals are&nbsp;those who are 24 years old or younger and were in foster care on the date of attaining 18 years of age or a higher age.&nbsp;Specifically, this section eliminates the current exclusion from the additional work requirements for these individuals based on this status.</p><p>Finally, this section limits the ability of a state to temporarily suspend the three-month time limit for SNAP benefits for ABAWDS in areas with high unemployment or an insufficient number of jobs. Under current law, the ABAWD waiver program allows states to request a temporary waiver of the three-month SNAP benefit limit. States may receive a waiver based on an area having an unemployment rate of over 10% or an insufficient number of jobs.</p><p>The section repeals the provision that allows a state waiver if that area does not have a sufficient number of jobs. Further, the section allows Alaska and Hawaii to qualify for the state exemption with an unemployment rate that is at or above 1.5 times the national unemployment rate, effectively lowering the unemployment rate that these states must meet to receive a waiver.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10103) This section generally eliminates the ability of a household to use participation in certain energy assistance programs to determine SNAP income eligibility unless&nbsp;the household includes an elderly or disabled member.&nbsp;</p><p>As background, a household may deduct a portion of their housing and utility costs from their income (i.e., the excess shelter expense deduction) when determining SNAP benefits. Under current law, a household that receives a certain level of energy assistance through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) or a similar energy assistance program may deduct a set allowance. This set allowance&nbsp;(i.e., Standard Utility Allowance or SUA) represents low-income household utility costs in the state or local area. Using this allowance makes qualifying for an excess shelter deduction more likely.</p><p>This section&nbsp;eliminates the use of the set allowance for households without elderly or disabled members, which may decrease the availability of the excess shelter deduction and reduce the SNAP benefits for these households.</p><p>(Sec.&nbsp;10104)&nbsp;This section prohibits a household from using any internet connection service fees as part of their housing and utility costs for the purposes of determining the size of household SNAP benefits, thus potentially reducing the SNAP benefits for these households.</p><p>As background, a household may deduct a portion of their housing and utility costs from their income (i.e., the excess shelter expense&nbsp;deduction) when determining SNAP benefits.&nbsp;Under current law, household expenses may include&nbsp;internet connection service fees.</p><p>(Sec. 10105) This section establishes state-matching fund requirements for the cost of SNAP program allotments&nbsp;beginning in FY2028. The state contribution ranges from 0% to 15% for the cost of SNAP program allotments and is based on the state’s SNAP payment error rate. Currently, the state match is 0%.</p><p>For FY2028, a state may elect either the FY2025 or FY2026 payment error rate to calculate its state-matching fund requirement. For FY2029 and each fiscal year thereafter, the state match is calculated using the payment error rate for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the state share is being calculated.</p><p>Any state that has a payment error rate that is less than 6% will have a state match of 0% (i.e., the state does not have to contribute).&nbsp;</p><p>A state with a payment error rate that is</p><ul><li>at least 6% but less than 8% must contribute 5%,</li><li>at least 8% but less than 10% must contribute 10%, and</li><li>10% or greater must contribute 15%.</li></ul><p>In general,&nbsp;the&nbsp;effective date for the state-matching fund requirements&nbsp;is the beginning of FY2028. However, any state that has an error rate above a certain level will have implementation delayed until FY2029 or&nbsp;FY2030. Specifically, the implementation date is delayed for states where the state's error rate multiplied by 1.5 equals or exceeds 20% in FY2025 or FY2026. For such states, the implementation date is delayed until FY2029 if specified error rate occurs in FY2025 and until FY2030 if the error rate occurs in FY2026.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10106) This section reduces the amount that USDA may pay a state agency for administrative costs for the operation of SNAP to 25% of all administrative costs beginning in FY2027 and for each fiscal year thereafter. Currently, USDA must pay 50% of all administrative costs, thus this section increases the state share of administrative costs from 50% to 75%.</p><p>(Sec. 10107) This section eliminates funding for the SNAP Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program (SNAP-ED). SNAP state and local agencies administer this federal grant program. SNAP-Ed uses evidence-based, public health projects and interventions with the goal to implement a nutrition education and obesity prevention program for eligible individuals that promotes healthy food choices and physical activity consistent with the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans.</p><p>(Sec. 10108) This section&nbsp;eliminates SNAP eligibility for certain individuals who are classified as an alien under federal law and legally present in the United States, including those who have qualified for conditional entry under the asylum and refugee laws or&nbsp;based on urgent humanitarian&nbsp;reasons (e.g., a&nbsp;survivor of domestic violence or human trafficking).</p><p>The section maintains SNAP eligibility for&nbsp;individuals who reside in the United States and are (1) U.S. citizens or U.S. nationals; (2) lawful permanent residents, with exceptions; (3) aliens who are Cuban or Haitian&nbsp; entrants; or (4) individuals who are lawfully residing in the United States in accordance with the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and&nbsp;Palau.</p><p>Subtitle B-- Forestry</p><p>(Sec. 10201) This section rescinds certain funds provided to the Forest Service as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. For example, this includes the rescission of funds for&nbsp;</p><ul><li>the protection of old-growth forests on National Forest System land,</li><li>grants for nonfederal forest landowners for climate mitigation or forest resilience practices,</li><li>grants for state and private forestry conservation programs for tree planting, and</li><li>administrative costs for the National Forest System to implement these and other related programs.</li></ul><p>Subtitle C--Commodities</p><p>This subtitle amends and extends commodity support programs.</p><p>For example, the subtitle extends the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program, the Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC)&nbsp; program, and Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) through crop year 2031. It also modifies various requirements for the programs.</p><p>(Sec. 10301) This section increases the reference prices for specified commodities under the ARC and&nbsp;PLC programs for crop years 2025 through 2030. This change would increase the likelihood of triggering a payment and increase the payments made to eligible producers when triggered.</p><p>Beginning in crop year 2031, USDA must increase the reference price so that it is equal to the reference price in the previous crop year multiplied by 1.005. USDA must continue to increase the reference price using this formula for each crop year after 2031, up to a maximum of 113% of the 2030 reference price.</p><p>The ARC and&nbsp;PLC programs, administered by the Farm Service Agency, offer financial assistance to eligible agricultural producers, and the reference prices are used to calculate benefits under the programs.&nbsp;The ARC program is an income support program that provides payments to producers triggered when actual crop revenue declines below a specified guarantee level. The&nbsp;PLC program provides income support payments triggered when the effective price for a covered commodity falls below its effective reference price.</p><p>(Sec. 10302) This section grants eligible agricultural producers a one-time option to expand and allocate base acre holdings in proportion to average 2019-2023 plantings of covered and&nbsp;noncovered commodities. In general, the Price Loss Coverage and Agriculture Risk Coverage programs make payments per enrolled base acre (i.e., a unit of production associated with specific tracts of farmland in proportion to historical production of certain crops).</p><p>This section allows producers to allocate existing unassigned base acres to a covered commodity. The section limits the total existing unassigned and newly granted base acres to no more than 30 million acres, effectively increasing total base acres nationwide from approximately 274 million to approximately 304 million.</p><p>(Sec. 10303)&nbsp;This section requires producers to make an election to obtain ARC or PLC on a covered-commodity-by-covered commodity basis through crop year 2031.&nbsp;For the 2025 crop year, this section requires USDA, on a covered commodity-by-covered commodity basis, to make the higher of PLC payments or ARC county coverage payments to the producers on a farm for the payment acres for each covered commodity on the&nbsp;farm.</p><p>(Sec. 10304) This section extends the&nbsp;PLC program through crop year 2031.</p><p>(Sec. 10305) This section extends the ARC program through the 2031 crop year. It also increases the coverage guarantee level from 86% to 90% of the benchmark revenue and increases the maximum payment amount&nbsp;from 10% to 12.5% of the&nbsp;benchmark revenue. These changes increase the likelihood of triggering a payment and increase the payments made to eligible producers when triggered. &nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10306) This section establishes a definition for a qualified pass-through entity, which includes certain partnerships and S corporations (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) and certain limited liability companies, joint ventures, and general partnerships. It also generally requires these entities to be treated in the same manner as current law treats general partnerships and joint ventures for the purpose of payment limitations. For example, the section replaces an existing exception to payment limitations for joint ventures and general partnerships with an exception for qualified pass-through entities.</p><p>(Sec. 10307) This section increases the maximum ARC and&nbsp;PLC&nbsp;payment limit per person from $125,000 to $155,000. A producer is eligible to receive up to $155,000 in peanut payments and up to $155,000 in payments for all commodities except peanuts (i.e., up to $310,000 total for all commodities inclusive). USDA must adjust payment limits for inflation annually beginning with the 2025 crop year.</p><p>As background, certain payment limits and eligibility criteria apply to multiple farm programs, including ARC,&nbsp;PLC, and certain disaster assistance programs and conservation programs.</p><p>(Sec. 10308) This section waives the adjusted gross income (AGI) limitations for payments or benefits under certain USDA disaster assistance and conservation programs for a person or legal entity that derives a portion of their income from agriculture. Specifically, the exception allows producers and business entities whose AGI exceeds $900,000 to participate in certain disaster assistance and conservation programs if 75% or more of their AGI (i.e., gross income before applying adjustments to calculate the AGI) is derived from eligible agricultural activities.</p><p>The eligible activities are farming, ranching, or siviculture activities, including&nbsp;agritourism, direct-to-consumer marketing of agricultural products, and the sale of agricultural equipment owned by such person or entity.</p><p>(Sec. 10309) This section extends the Marketing Assistance Loan (MAL) program nonrecourse and recourse loans through the 2031 crop year. It also sets MAL rates for crop years 2026-2031. This section also extends Loan Deficiency Payments (LDPs) through the 2031 crop year. The MAL and LDP programs provide price support to producers when market prices drop below statutory levels.</p><p>This section also extends the Special Competitive Provisions for Extra Long Staple (ELS) Cotton program. This program makes payments to eligible mills that use ELS cotton and eligible exporters of ELS cotton.</p><p>As background, there are two main species of cotton cultivated for commercial use, upland cotton (which comprises 97% of U.S. production) and extra-long staple (ELS) cotton. U.S.-grown ELS cotton is also referred to as Pima cotton.</p><p>(Sec. 10310) This section changes how world prices for upland and ELS cotton are calculated for the purpose of repaying&nbsp;MALs.</p><p>(Sec. 10311) This section increases the payments to domestic users of upland cotton who participate in the Economic Adjustment Assistance for Textile Mills program. This program makes monthly payments to eligible domestic cotton mills. The payments must be used for capital investments that contribute to domestic manufacturing of upland cotton.</p><p>(Sec. 10312) This section makes several modification to USDA's sugar program.&nbsp;As background, the U.S. sugar program supports the U.S. sugar industry (i.e., producers and processors of sugarcane and sugar beets) by providing Marketing Assistance Loans (MALs) to sugar processors, restricting domestic supply of sugar with marketing allotments for sugar processors, and limiting sugar imports through tariff-rate quotas.</p><p>Specifically, this section increases the marketing loan rate for raw sugar cane processors and increases the rate for beet sugar processors for crop years 2025-2031.</p><p>This section also increases the storage rates USDA pays to processors for forfeited refined sugar and forfeited raw cane sugar. Under current law, when sugar is used to&nbsp;collateralize a MAL loan and is forfeited by a sugar processor, USDA must provide payments to the processors who store the forfeited sugar.</p><p>This section extends the provisions for the flexible marketing allotments for sugar through crop year 2031. In addition, in operating sugar support programs, USDA must prioritize sugar beet processors if marketing allotments are adjusted higher. Additionally, if sugar beet marketing allotments need to be adjusted, USDA must reassign sugar beet marketing allotments within 30 days of the publication of USDA's January World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, USDA must study whether the establishment of additional terms and conditions with respect to refined sugar imports is necessary and appropriate and submit a report to Congress. Based on the study, USDA may issue regulations to establish additional terms and conditions for refined sugar imports.</p><p>(Sec. 10313) This section extends Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) through crop year 2031 and provides for a number of changes to the DMC program.</p><p>As background, DMC allows participating milk producers to buy a guaranteed margin for their milk production.&nbsp;The DMC program pays participating producers the difference between a producer-selected guarantee and the national milk margin (all-milk price minus an average feed cost ration). Margin payments are based on producers' milk production history, not actual milk marketings (i.e., quantity of milk sold). Producers pay annual premium rates based on two tiers of production history.</p><p>Changes to the program include</p><ul><li>altering how USDA determines&nbsp;production history to remove the consideration of production at the time the dairy operation first registered to participate in the DMC program;</li><li>setting production history for the DMC program as the highest annual milk marketings for participating dairies during calendar year 2021, 2022, or 2023;</li><li>raising the coverage limit to the first 6 million pounds of production history for both Tier I and Tier II premiums, from the first 5 million pounds; and</li><li>allowing producers to receive a 25% premium discount for a one-time premium election covering calendar years 2026-2031.</li></ul><p>(Sec. 10314)&nbsp; This section requires USDA to make available specified funds to carry out this subtitle. It also requires USDA to use specified funds to administer a mandatory survey of dairy product manufacturers' production costs and product yield information. USDA must&nbsp;publish the results of the surveys&nbsp;biennially.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Subtitle D--Disaster Assistance Programs</p><p>This subtitle expands the types of eligible losses covered under the permanently authorized agricultural disaster assistance programs, which include the Livestock Indemnity Program; the Livestock Forage Disaster Program; the&nbsp;Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program; and the&nbsp;Tree Assistance Program. This subtitle also increases coverage levels and lowers the threshold for triggering payments for certain eligible losses.</p><p>(Sec. 10401) Under the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP), this section increases the payment rate to 100%, from 75%, for losses due to predation (i.e., attacks by animals reintroduced into the wild by the federal government or protected by federal law). This section also authorizes USDA to allow eligible producers to submit documentation to assist in determining an animal's market value. Further, the section expands LIP coverage to include unborn livestock as LIP- eligible livestock losses. LIP provides indemnity payments to eligible livestock owners and contract growers for livestock deaths in excess of normal mortality or reduced sales prices due to specified events (e.g., adverse weather, disease, or animal attack).</p><p>Under the Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP), this section expands the types of eligible drought conditions covered and increases payments for certain eligible drought conditions under the program. The LFP program makes payments to eligible livestock producers who have suffered grazing losses due to&nbsp;drought-affected pastureland&nbsp;or a fire on federally managed rangelands.</p><p>Under the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP), this section expands eligible losses to include bird predation of farm-raised fish and adds an eligible loss threshold when determining honey bee colony losses. ELAP provides payments to producers of livestock, honey bees, and farm-raised fish as compensation for losses due to disease, adverse weather, feed or water shortages, or other conditions that are not covered under other programs.</p><p>Under the Tree Assistance Program (TAP), this section lowers the eligible normal mortality loss threshold and increases assistance for eligible rehabilitation costs. TAP provides financial assistance to qualifying orchardists and nursery tree growers to replant or rehabilitate eligible trees, bushes, and vines damaged by natural disasters.</p><p>Subtitle&nbsp;E--Crop Insurance</p><p>This subtitle increases certain crop insurance premium subsidies and increases additional premium subsidies available for beginning farmers and ranchers. The subtitle also increases coverage levels for Supplemental Coverage Option&nbsp;(i.e., a type of county-level coverage) and Whole Farm Revenue Protection policies, increases support for administrative and operating (A&amp;O) costs incurred by approved crop insurance providers, and increases funds available for program compliance and integrity.</p><p>As background, the Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP) offers subsidized crop insurance policies that producers can purchase to cover a wide variety of crops and livestock. These policies pay indemnities for yield and revenue losses caused by adverse growing and market conditions, including natural disasters. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC)—a government corporation within USDA—subsidizes part of the policy premium.</p><p>(Sec. 10501) This section increases the premium subsidies available for beginning farmers or ranchers for an applicable insurance policy or plan.</p><p>Further, farmers and ranchers are eligible to qualify for the program for 10 years, an increase from 5 years. Specifically, a farmer or rancher must not have actively operated and managed a farm or ranch for more than 10 crop years to be considered a beginning farmer or rancher.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10502) This section expands the maximum coverage level from 85% to 90% for individual yield or revenue coverage aggregated across multiple commodities (e.g., Whole-Farm Revenue Protection policies). &nbsp;</p><p>The section also expands the&nbsp;Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO) and increases SCO premium subsidies from 65% to 80%. It also increases the SCO coverage level from 86% to 90%.</p><p>(Sec. 10503) This section increases administrative and operating (A&amp;O) subsidies in certain states and years with relatively high losses.</p><p>As background, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) subsidizes part of the policy premium. The policyholders (i.e., farmers and ranchers)&nbsp;pay any remaining premium. Private insurance companies&nbsp;sell and service the policies in return for A&amp;O subsidies from the FCIC.</p><p>This section also establishes a minimum A&amp;O reimbursement&nbsp;rate for specialty crop policies&nbsp;each year beginning in the 2026 reinsurance year. The rate must be equal to or greater than the percentage that is the greater of (1) 17% of the premium used to define loss ratio, and (2) the percentage of the premium used to define loss ratio that is otherwise applicable for the reinsurance year under the terms of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement in effect for the reinsurance year.</p><p>Finally, beginning with the 2026 reinsurance year, the section requires&nbsp;USDA to annually increase the total A&amp;O reimbursements that would otherwise be required in order to account for inflation.</p><p>(Sec. 10504) This section increases certain crop insurance premium subsidies. The increases range from 3% to 5%, depending on the coverage level.</p><p>(Sec. 10505) This section increases funding for available information technologies (i.e., data mining and data warehousing) to administer and enforce program compliance and integrity.</p><p>(Sec. 10506) This section increases funding for (1) the operations and review of policies, plans of insurance, and related materials; and&nbsp;(2) maintaining program actuarial soundness and financial integrity.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10507) This section provides for the establishment of a Poultry Insurance Pilot Program to provide contract poultry growers with&nbsp;index-based insurance for&nbsp;extreme weather-related risk resulting in increased utility costs&nbsp;associated with poultry production. Under an index policy, claim payments are generally triggered based on a predetermined index that is entirely independent of the individual farm operation (e.g., rainfall level). Under such a policy, the payments are automatically triggered when the index reaches a certain level rather than when an insured farmer files a claim.</p><p>Subtitle F--Additional Investments in Rural America&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10601) This section rescinds the unobligated funds that were provided for the Agriculture Conservation Easement Program (ACEP), the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), and the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP)&nbsp; as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The section also adds funds to the&nbsp;permanent farm bill baseline for these programs.

The SALT deduction cap increases in 2026 to $40,400 ( $20,200 for married individuals filing separately) and, then, by 1% each year after 2026, through 2029. In 2030, under this section, the SALT deduction cap reverts to $10,000 (or&nbsp;$5,000 for married individuals filing separately).</p><p>Further, under this section, the amount of state and local taxes allowed as a federal tax deduction is reduced (but not below $10,000 or $5,000 for married individuals filing separately) by 30% of the amount that an individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds the threshold amount. The threshold amount in 2025 is $500,000 ( $250,000 for married individuals filing separately).

(Bonus depreciation generally allows a business to deduct either the full cost or a large percentage of the cost of qualified property in the year that the property is placed into service, rather than depreciating such costs over a period of time.)</p><p>(Sec. 70302) This section allows taxpayers to deduct domestic research and experimental expenses in the year such expenses are incurred (rather than requiring taxpayers to capitalize and amortize such expenses over 5 years or, if elected, over 10 years). However, under this section, taxpayers must continue to capitalize and amortize over a 15-year period foreign research and experimental expenses.</p><p>Under this section, taxpayers may elect to capitalize and amortize over at least 60 months domestic research and experimental expenses.

(For tax years beginning before 2026, a domestic corporation generally is allowed a foreign tax credit of up to 80% of such foreign income taxes paid or accrued.)&nbsp;</p><p>As background, the allowance of a tax credit for only a percentage of the foreign taxes paid or accrued on net CFC tested income is also known as the foreign tax credit haircut. Thus, under this section, the foreign tax credit haircut is decreased to 10% (from 20%).</p><p>This section also applies the 10% foreign tax credit haircut to foreign income taxes paid or accrued on &nbsp;distributions of previously taxed net CFC tested income.</p><p>(Sec. 70313) This section allows a percentage of the income from the sale of certain inventory to be treated as foreign-sourced income for purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit.</p><p>Specifically, under this section, a U.S. person may treat as foreign-sourced income up to 50% of the income from the sale of inventory produced in the United States (for use outside of the United States) that is attributable to a foreign office or fixed place of business outside of the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>Part II--Foreign-Derived Deduction Eligible Income and Net&nbsp;CFC Tested Income</p><p>This part makes multiple changes to the tax deduction allowed to a domestic corporation for foreign-derived intangible income and GILTI.</p><p>Below is a summary of the provisions in the part.</p><p>(Sec. 70321) This section increases the tax deduction allowed to a domestic corporation for foreign-derived deduction eligible income (formerly known as foreign-derived intangible income and renamed under Section 70323 of this act)&nbsp;and net CFC tested income (formerly known as GILTI and renamed under Section 70323 of this act).</p><p>Under this section, for tax years beginning in 2026, a domestic corporation generally may claim a tax deduction equal to the sum of (1) 33.34% of such corporation’s foreign-derived deduction eligible income, and (2) 40% of such corporation’s net CFC tested income.</p><p>As background, for tax years beginning after 2017 and before 2026,&nbsp;a domestic corporation generally is allowed a tax deduction equal to the sum of (1) 37.5% of such corporation’s foreign-derived intangible income, and (2) 50% of such corporation’s GILTI. As enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and prior to modification by this section, the deduction decreased starting in 2026, to the sum of (1) 21.875% of such corporation’s foreign-derived intangible income, and (2) 37.5% of such corporation’s GILTI and amounts treated as dividends attributable to such amounts.</p><p>(Sec. 70322) This section excludes gain from the sale or disposition of certain property&nbsp;from the calculation of the tax deduction for foreign-derived deduction eligible income.</p><p>Specifically, under this section, deduction eligible income (for purposes of the tax deduction for foreign-derived deduction eligible income) may not include&nbsp;gain from the sale or other disposition (including the deemed sale or other disposition) occurring after June 16, 2025, of (1) property of a type that gives rise to rents or royalties, and (2) any other property that is subject to depreciation, amortization, or depletion by the seller of such property.</p><p>Further, under this section, deduction&nbsp;eligible income must be reduced by expenses and deductions directly related to such income.</p><p>(Sec. 70323) This section eliminates the use of a domestic corporation’s deemed tangible income return in determining foreign-derived intangible income and such corporation’s net deemed tangible income return in determining GILTI. As a result, under this section, the term foreign-derived intangible income is renamed foreign-derived deduction eligible income and the term GILTI is renamed net CFC tested income.</p><p>Part III--Base Erosion Minimum Tax</p><p>This part makes changes to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT).</p><p>Below is a summary of the provision in this part.</p><p>(Sec. 70331) This section decreases the BEAT rate to 10.5% (from 12.5%) for tax years beginning after 2025.

(Under the CFC look-through rule, certain interest expenses, dividends, rents, and royalties received by one CFC from a related CFC are not treated as foreign personal holding company income [for purposes of calculating subpart F income] if certain other requirements are met.)</p><p>(Sec. 70352) This section requires a specified foreign corporation (generally a CFC or any foreign corporation with respect to which one or more domestic corporations is a U.S. shareholder) to use the taxable year of their majority U.S. shareholder , effective for tax years beginning after November 30, 2025. (For tax years beginning on or before November 30, 2025, a specified foreign corporation may elect a tax year beginning one month earlier than the majority U.S. shareholder.)</p><p>Chapter 4--Investing in American Families, Communities, and Small Businesses</p><p>Subchapter A--Permanent Investments in Families and Children</p><p>This subchapter makes multiple changes to federal tax provisions related to children and dependents.</p><p>Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.</p><p>(Sec. 70401) This section increases the tax credit for employers that provide child care to their employees. Under this section, the portion of the tax credit for qualified child care expenses increases to 40% (from 25%) or to 50% for eligible small businesses. This section also increases the maximum amount of the tax credit to $500,000 (from $150,000) or $600,000 for eligible small businesses (adjusted for inflation).</p><p>(Sec. 70402) This section makes up to $5,000 of the adoption tax credit refundable and adjusts this amount annually for inflation after 2025. However, under this section, the refundable portion of the adoption tax credit may not be carried forward. (Under current law, the amount of the allowed adoption tax credit that exceeds an individual’s tax liability may be carried forward for up to five years.)</p><p>(Sec. 70403) This section allows Indian tribal governments to determine whether a child has special needs for purposes of calculating the adoption tax credit.</p><p>(Sec. 70404) This section increases to $7,500 (or $3,750 for a married individual filing separately) from $5,000 (or $2,500 for a married person filing separately) the exclusion from gross income for amounts paid or incurred by an employer to an employee as part of a dependent care assistance program.</p><p>(Sec. 70405) This section increases the non-refundable tax credit for expenses paid by an individual for the care of a child or dependent that enable such individual to be gainfully employed.&nbsp;</p><p>Subchapter B--Permanent Investments in Students and Reforms to Tax-Exempt Institutions</p><p>This subchapter makes multiple changes to federal tax provisions related to education and certain educational institutions.</p><p>Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.</p><p>(Sec. 70411) This section establishes a nonrefundable tax credit of up to $1,700 for cash contributions made by an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States to a tax-exempt organization that provides scholarships for qualified elementary and secondary school expenses to eligible students (scholarship granting organization), subject to limitations.</p><p>(Sec. 70412) This section makes permanent the exclusion of education assistance paid by an employer to an employee (up to a maximum amount) from (1) gross income by an employee, and (2) wages by an employer (for employment tax purposes). Further, under this section, the maximum amount ($5,250 for 2025 and 2026) of employer-paid education assistance that may be excluded from gross income and wages is adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2027.</p><p>(Sec. 70413) This section expands the expenses eligible for tax-free withdrawals from qualified tuition programs (529 plans) to include certain additional expenses related to elementary, secondary, or&nbsp;homeschool education. &nbsp;</p><p>This section also increases to $20,000 (from $10,000) the limit on distributions from a 529 plan used in connection with enrollment or attendance at an elementary or secondary school.</p><p>(Sec. 70414) This section expands the expenses eligible for tax-free withdrawals from 529 plans to include tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment, and other expenses related to the enrollment or attendance in a recognized postsecondary credentialing program.</p><p>(Sec. 70415) This section replaces the excise tax of 1.4% imposed on the net investment income of certain private university and college endowments with a new rate structure of 1.4%, 4%, or 8%, depending on several variables including the value of the endowment and the number of full-time students who meet certain other requirements.</p><p>(Sec. 70416) This section expands the excise tax imposed on certain tax-exempt organizations for excess compensation paid to certain employees (an employee who is one of the top five highest compensated employees of such organization) to include excess compensation paid to any employee of such organization. (Thus, a tax-exempt organization is liable for an excise equal to the corporate tax rate [21%] multiplied by the sum of remuneration in excess of $1 million and excess parachute payment paid to any employee by the tax-exempt organization.)</p><p>Subchapter C--Permanent Investments in Community Development</p><p>This subchapter makes multiple changes to certain federal tax incentives related to investing in certain communities and tax deductions for charitable contributions.</p><p>Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.</p><p>(Sec. 70421) This section permanently extends the Opportunity Zone program, establishes specific tax incentives for investments in rural areas, and modifies the rules related to deferred gains and stepped-up basis.</p><p>As background, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act temporarily authorized tax incentives for investments (made through qualified opportunity funds) in designated economically distressed areas (called qualified opportunity zones). Specifically, qualified opportunity fund investors may (1) defer capital gain if such gain is reinvested in a qualified opportunity fund within 180 days, (2) exclude from gross income all (or part) of the capital gains from qualified opportunity fund investments held for a certain period of time, and (3) receive a step up in basis (value of the capital asset when it is sold) of 10% for qualified opportunity fund investments held for at least five years and an additional 5% for qualified opportunity fund investments held for at least seven years. (An increase in the basis of a capital asset generally lowers the taxable amount of such asset.)</p><p>Under this section, capital gains from qualified opportunity fund investments made beginning in 2027, may be deferred to the earlier of the date on which such investment is sold or exchanged or five years after the date on which the investment is made. (Capital gain from qualified opportunity investments made before 2027, may be deferred to the earlier of the date on which such investment is sold or exchanged or December 31, 2026. (Thus, this section establishes a rolling five-year deferral for capital gains from qualified opportunity funds.)</p><p>This section also eliminates the additional 5% step up in basis for qualified opportunity zone fund investments held for at least 7 years, but increases the basis for such investments held for at least 10 years to the fair market value of the investment.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, this section establishes qualified rural opportunity funds for investments in rural areas. Investors in qualified rural opportunity funds may be eligible for a 30% step up in basis if certain requirements are met.</p><p>(Sec. 70422) This section increases eligibility for the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) by increasing the amount that a state may allocate for the LIHTC and reducing the tax-exempt bond financing threshold.</p><p>As background, a taxpayer may claim the LIHTC for expenses incurred to rehabilitate or build rental housing for low-income tenants (1) if an allocation for the LIHTC is received from the state, or (2) a percentage of the project is financed by certain tax-exempt bonds. The amount a state may allocate for the LIHTC is calculated, in part, by multiplying a certain dollar amount (adjusted annually for inflation) by the state’s population.&nbsp;</p><p>Under this section, beginning in 2026, the portion of the federal allocation to each state for the LIHTC that is based on the state’s population is increased by 12%.</p><p>Further, this section lowers to 25% (from 50%) the tax-exempt bond threshold. Thus, under this section, if 25% or more of the aggregate basis (i.e., generally the costs) of the building and the land on which the building is located is financed with tax-exempt bonds, then the taxpayer is eligible for the LIHTC for the entire eligible basis of the project without a LIHTC allocation from the state. (If less than 25% of such basis is financed with tax-exempt bonds, then only the basis of the project that is financed with the tax-exempt bonds is eligible for the LIHTC.)</p><p>(Sec. 70423) This section permanently extends the New Markets Tax Credit (a tax credit for certain investments in eligible, low-income communities).</p><p>(Sec. 70424) This section makes permanent and increases to $1,000 for single filers (from $300) or $2,000 for joint filers (from $600 for joint filers) the tax deduction for charitable contributions made by individuals who do not itemize their federal income tax deductions.</p><p>(Sec. 70425) This section imposes a new limitation on the itemized tax deduction for charitable contributions made by individuals beginning in 2026. Under this section, an itemized tax deduction for charitable contributions is allowed only to the extent that an individual’s aggregate charitable contributions exceed 0.5% of the individual’s contribution base (adjusted gross income calculated without including any net operating loss carryback amount). (This limitation is generally known as the 0.5% floor for the itemized tax deduction for individual charitable contributions and does not apply to tax deductions for charitable contributions made by individuals who do not itemize their tax deductions under Section 70424 of this act.)</p><p>Further, under this section, the 0.5% floor also applies to excess charitable contributions made by individuals in 2026 or after that are carried forward to subsequent tax years. (Excess charitable contributions made prior to 2026 that are carried forward to subsequent tax year are not subject to the 0.5% floor.)&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 70426) This section further limits the tax deduction for charitable contributions made by a corporation beginning in 2026. Under this section, a tax deduction for charitable contributions made by a corporation is allowed only to the extent that the corporation’s aggregate charitable contributions exceed 1% of the corporation’s taxable income. (This limitation is generally known as the 1% floor for the tax deduction for charitable contributions made by a corporation.)&nbsp;</p><p>As a result of the 1% floor imposed by this section and existing limitations, a corporation may deduct charitable contributions only to the extent that such contributions exceed 1% of the corporation’s taxable income but do not exceed 10% of the corporation’s taxable income (10% limit).</p><p>Finally, under this section, special rules and limitations also apply to corporate charitable contributions carried forward to subsequent tax years.</p><p>(Sec. 70427) This section reinstates and makes permanent (beginning in 2026) the $13.25 (currently $10.50) per proof gallon limit on the&nbsp;amount that is transferred by the United States to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for excise taxes collected on distilled spirits (e.g., rum) imported from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><p>As background, the United States imposes an excise tax of $13.50 per proof gallon on distilled spirits produced in or imported into the United States. A certain amount of the excise tax collected on distilled spirits imported from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are transferred back into the treasury of each possession. (This transfer is commonly known as the cover over or the rum cover over.) For 2022-2026, the rum cover over amount is limited to $10.50 per proof gallon. An additional rum cover over in the amount of $2.75 (for a total rum cover over of $13.25) authorized by Congress expired at the end of 2021.</p><p>(Sec. 70428) This section treats participation or investment in fisheries (e.g., harvesting, processing, transportation, sales, and marketing of fish and fish products) in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands by certain tax-exempt Alaskan villages as substantially related to the village’s tax-exempt purpose and, thus, income gained from such activities remains tax-exempt.</p><p>(Sec. 70429) This section increases to $50,000 (from $10,000) the limit on the tax deduction for &nbsp;expenses incurred by a whaling captain (as recognized by the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission) in carrying out sanctioned bowhead whaling activities.</p><p>(Sec. 70430) This section allows certain residential construction contracts entered into in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025, to use another permissible method of accounting (e.g., the uniform capitalization rules), rather than the percentage&nbsp;of&nbsp;completion method of accounting. (The percentage of completion method of accounting or the percentage of completion-capitalized cost accounting method of accounting is used for residential construction contracts that are not home construction contracts and that are entered into in tax years beginning on or before July 4, 2025.)</p><p>Subchapter D--Permanent Investments in Small Business and Rural America</p><p>This subchapter modifies certain reporting requirements related to third-party settlement organizations and makes changes to several other federal tax provisions.</p><p>Below is a summary of the key provisions in this subchapter.</p><p>(Sec. 70432) This section modifies the reporting requirements applicable to third-party settlement organizations (e.g., certain online platforms, apps, and card payment processors). Under this section, such organizations are required to issue Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1099-K to payees who receive more than $20,000 from more than 200 separate transactions. (This section reverses a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 that lowered the reporting threshold to $600 with no minimum on the number of transactions, the implementation of which was delayed and phased in by the IRS. For 2025, under current law, such organizations are required to issue IRS Form 1099-K to payees who receive more than $2,500, regardless of the number of transactions.)</p><p>(Sec. 70434) This section expands the federal tax deduction for certain film, television, and theatrical production costs to allow a deduction of up to $150,000 of qualified sound recording production costs in the tax year such costs are incurred. A qualified sound recording production is a sound recording that is produced and recorded in the United States. (Under current law, up to $20 million of film, television, and theatrical production costs incurred before 2026 may be deducted.)</p><p>The section also extends bonus depreciation to qualified sound recording production costs.</p><p>(Sec. 70436) This section eliminates the $200 excise tax imposed on the transfer of certain firearms other than machine guns and destructive devices&nbsp;(e.g., bombs, grenades, certain rockets, missiles, and mines). As a result, the $200 excise tax is not applicable to silencers, short-barreled rifles and short-barreled shotguns.</p><p>Chapter 5--Ending Green New Deal Spending, Promoting America-First Energy and Other Reforms</p><p>Subchapter A--Termination of Green New Deal Subsidies</p><p>This subchapter terminates multiple energy-related federal tax credits.</p><p>Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.</p><p>(Sec. 70501) This section terminates the previously-owned clean vehicle tax credit. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a tax credit of up to $4,000 for the purchase of a qualified previously-owned clean vehicle before October 1, 2025.)</p><p>(Sec. 70502) This section terminates the clean vehicle tax credit. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of a qualified new clean vehicle before October 1, 2025.)</p><p>(Sec. 70503) This section terminates the qualified commercial clean vehicle tax credit. (Thus, businesses may claim a tax credit of up to $40,000 for the purchase of a commercial clean vehicle before October 1, 2025.)</p><p>(Sec. 70504) This section terminates the alternative fuel refueling property tax credit. (Thus, a tax credit of up to $1,000 for individuals or up to $100,000 for businesses is allowed for the installation of property before July 1, 2026, that is used to store or dispense clean-burning fuel or to recharge electric vehicles.)</p><p>(Sec. 70505) This section terminates the energy efficient home improvement tax credit. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a tax credit of up to $3,200, for certain energy-efficient property purchased and installed into a primary residence before&nbsp;2026.)</p><p>(Sec. 70506) This section terminates the residential clean energy tax credit. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a tax credit for certain renewable energy equipment for a principal residence before&nbsp;2026.)</p><p>(Sec. 70507) This section terminates the energy efficient commercial buildings tax deduction. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a deduction for certain energy efficient commercial property the construction of which begins before July 1, 2027.)</p><p>(Sec. 70508) This section terminates the new energy efficient home tax credit. (Thus, contractors may claim a business tax credit for constructing an energy-efficient home that is acquired by a person for use as a residence before July 1, 2026.)</p><p>(Sec. 70509) This section terminates the special five-year cost recovery period for investments in certain solar and wind property for which construction begins after December 31, 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>As background, costs of property used in a trade or business to produce income generally are capitalized and then depreciated or amortized over a period of time (known as the cost recovery period). The cost recovery period for property used to produce electricity generally depends on the method for producing such electricity. However, for certain solar and wind property for which construction begins on or before December 31, 2024, the cost recovery period is five years. For solar and wind property for which construction begins after December 31, 2024, the general modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) and Internal Revenue Service guidance apply.</p><p>(Sec. 70510) This section disallows the zero-emission nuclear power production tax credit for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities). (The zero-emission nuclear power production tax credit generally is allowed for electricity produced at a qualified nuclear power facility and sold to an unrelated third person.)</p><p>(Sec. 70511) This section terminates the clean hydrogen production tax credit in 2028 and, thus, the tax credit is allowed only for clean hydrogen production facilities for which construction begins before January 1, 2028. (As background, prior to changes made by this section, the tax credit is available for the production of clean hydrogen by a qualifying facility for which construction begins before 2033.)</p><p>(Sec. 70512) This section terminates the clean electricity production tax credit for (1) wind and solar facilities placed into service after December 31, 2027, and (2) certain wind energy property or solar water heating property if such property is leased to a third party during the tax year. (As background, a tax credit is allowed, other than as provided by this section and subject to limitations, for clean electricity produced by a qualified facility. The tax credit is phased out beginning in the later of 2032 or when greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity are reduced to a certain level.) &nbsp;</p><p>This section also disallows the clean electricity production tax credit for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities).&nbsp;</p><p>Further, under this section, penalties may be imposed for (1) substantial misstatements of a certain amount related to the supply chain of manufactured products and product components for which the clean electricity production tax credit is claimed, and (2) overstating depreciable assets to claim the clean energy production tax credit. (Under this act, such penalties are also applicable to the clean electricity investment tax credit and the advanced manufacturing production tax credit.)</p><p>(Sec. 70513) This section terminates the clean electricity investment credit for (1) wind and solar property, other than energy storage technology, placed into service after December 31, 2027; and (2) certain wind energy property, solar electric property, and solar water heating property if such property is leased to a third party during the tax year. (As background, a tax credit is allowed, other than as provided by this section and subject to limitations, for certain investments in energy storage technology &nbsp;or a facility that is used for generating electricity with an anticipated greenhouse gas admission rate of not greater than zero.)</p><p>Under this section, the clean electricity production tax credit is not allowed for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities).&nbsp;</p><p>This section also sets the clean electricity production tax credit percentage to 30% (which may not be increased) for qualified fuel cell property for which construction begins after 2025. (As background, the clean electricity production tax credit is 6%, but may be increased to 30% if certain requirements are met, and further increased for property that is placed into service in certain locations, that meets certain construction requirements, or for which an allocation is received from the Clean Electricity Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Amount Program.)</p><p>(Sec. 70514) This section terminates the advanced manufacturing production credit for wind energy components produced and sold after 2027, and for metallurgical coal (i.e., coking coal or coal used to manufacture steel) produced after 2029. This section also phases out the advanced manufacturing production tax credit for other critical minerals produced after 2030, as follows:</p><ul><li>75% of the tax credit otherwise allowed for critical minerals produced in 2031,</li><li>50% of the tax credit otherwise allowed for critical minerals produced in 2032,</li><li>24% of the tax credit otherwise allowed for critical minerals produced in 2033, and</li><li>0% of the tax credit otherwise allowed for critical minerals produced in 2034.</li></ul><p>Under this section, the advanced manufacturing production tax credit is not allowed for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities).</p><p>(Sec. 70515) This section provides that the Department of the Treasury may not reallocate amounts that are (1) allocated for the qualified advanced energy projects tax credit, and (2) subsequently revoked. (As background, the Treasury may allocate up to $10 billion [in the form of a tax credit] to taxpayers for approved investments in certain advanced energy projects, subject to certain conditions and limitations. An allocation of the tax credit may be revoked if the project is not completed on time or certain other requirements are not met.)&nbsp;</p><p>Subchapter B--Enhancement of America-First Energy Policy</p><p>This subchapter modifies multiple energy-related federal tax provisions and makes changes to the calculation of the corporate alternative minimum tax.</p><p>Below&nbsp;is a summary of the key provisions in this subchapter.</p><p>(Sec. 70521) This section extends the clean fuel production tax credit through 2029 and</p><ul><li>requires that clean fuels produced from feedstock use feedstock sourced from the Unites States, Canada, or Mexico;</li><li>excludes emissions attributable to an indirect land use change from the calculation of lifecycle emissions estimates (used in part of the calculation of the clean fuel production tax credit); and</li><li>requires the Department of the Treasury to provide distinct emission rates for specific&nbsp;feedstocks used to produce clean fuels, including dairy manure, swine manure, and poultry manure.</li></ul><p>This section also disallows the clean fuel production tax credit for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities).</p><p>(Sec. 70522) This section increases the carbon oxide sequestration tax credit to $17 (from $12) per metric ton for qualified carbon dioxide used (1) as a tertiary injectant in a qualified oil or gas natural recovery project and then securely stored or (2) by fixing such carbon dioxide through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, chemical conversion, or for some other commercial market purpose. (As a result, the same carbon oxide sequestration tax credit applies to carbon oxide captured and sequestered and carbon dioxide captured, used, and then sequestered.)</p><p>This section also disallows the carbon oxide sequestration tax credit for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities).</p><p>(Sec. 70523) This section allows corporations to reduce their adjusted financial statement income (for purposes of calculating the corporate alternative minimum tax) to account for certain intangible costs related to oil, gas, or geothermal well drilling and development.</p><p>(Sec. 70525) This section provides for a refund of previously imposed and paid excise taxes upon the transfer of nontaxable, indelibly dyed diesel fuel or kerosene used for agricultural, off-road, or other nontaxable purposes.</p><p>Subchapter C--Other Reforms</p><p>This subchapter eliminates the de minimis exemption for certain imports into the United States and establishes a new civil penalty for using such exemption in a manner that violates U.S. customs laws.</p><p>Below is a summary of the provision in this subchapter.</p><p>(Sec. 70531) This section eliminates the exemption from certain duties, fees, and&nbsp;processes for imports of up to $800 (commonly referred to as the de minimis exemption), effective July 1, 2027.</p><p>Further, this section establishes a civil penalty for entering, introducing, facilitating, or attempting to introduce an article into the United States using the de minimis exemption in a manner that violates U.S. customs laws.

The restrictions do not apply to certain mandatory emergency services provided to individuals who are not lawfully residing in the United States or to optional services provided to certain lawfully residing children and pregnant women.</p><p>Current law authorizes federal payment with respect to additional categories of individuals, including refugees; noncitizens granted parole for at least one year, asylum, or related relief; and Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) self-petitioners. The section excludes these individuals from eligibility.&nbsp;</p><p>The section provides $15 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.</p><p>(Sec. 71110) This section reduces the Medicaid federal matching rate for emergency services provided to individuals who are not lawfully residing in the United States but who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population in states that have expanded Medicaid. Specifically, the section limits, beginning in FY2027, the Medicaid federal matching rate for emergency services provided to individuals who are not lawfully residing in the United States to the same matching rate as would otherwise apply for such services (rather than the enhanced federal matching rate for states that have expanded Medicaid).</p><p>The section provides $1 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.</p><p>Subchapter B--Preventing Wasteful Spending</p><p>(Sec. 71111) This section delays until FY2035 implementation of certain provisions of the rule titled <em>Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities and Medicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting</em>, which was issued by the CMS on May 10, 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, the section delays provisions of the rule that, among other changes, (1) establish minimum staffing standards for nurses in Medicare and Medicaid long-term care facilities, including requiring a nurse to be onsite 24/7 and requiring a minimum of 3.48 total nurse staffing hours per resident per day; and (2) require state Medicaid programs to report on payments to direct care workers and support staff of nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 71112) This section shortens the window for retroactive Medicaid coverage. Specifically, the section specifies that, beginning with the first quarter after December 31, 2026, Medicaid coverage may begin retroactively (1) for individuals in the Medicaid expansion population, one month prior to the application filing date; and (2) for all other individuals, two months prior to the application filing date. Additionally, CHIP coverage may retroactively begin two months prior to the application filing date. (Currently, coverage may begin three months prior to the application filing date.)</p><p>The section provides $10 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.</p><p>(Sec. 71113) This section prohibits federal Medicaid payment for one year to nonprofit health care providers that serve predominantly low-income, medically underserved individuals (i.e., essential community providers) if the provider (1) primarily furnishes family planning services, reproductive health, and related care; (2) offers abortions in cases other than that of rape, incest, or life-threatening conditions for the woman; and (3) in FY2023, received federal and state Medicaid payments totaling more than $800,000.</p><p>The section provides $1 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.</p><p>Subchapter C--Stopping Abusive Financing Practices</p><p>(Sec. 71114) This section requires states that had not chosen to expand Medicaid pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act prior to March 11, 2021, to do so by January 1, 2026, in order to receive the corresponding enhanced federal matching rate.</p><p>(Sec. 71115) This section generally limits Medicaid provider taxes beginning in FY2027.</p><p>Under current law, states may impose a provider tax of up to 6% of net patient service revenues to potentially receive additional federal matching funds. The section precludes states that have not expanded Medicaid from increasing the rate of a provider tax beyond that currently in effect in order to qualify for federal matching funds. For states that have expanded Medicaid, a provider tax may not exceed the current rate or a specified rate, whichever is lower; the maximum rate gradually decreases from FY2028-FY2032, with a maximum rate of 3.5% beginning in FY2032 (these limits do not apply to nursing and intermediate care facilities, which are instead limited to current rates). The section additionally precludes states from imposing a new provider tax if there is not already one in effect.</p><p>The section provides $20 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.</p><p>(Sec. 71116) This section provides $7 million per fiscal year for FY2026-FY2033 for the CMS to revise regulations so as to limit state-directed payments for inpatient hospital services, outpatient hospital services, nursing facility services, and qualified practitioner services at an academic medical center under Medicaid managed care contracts to the payment rate for services under Medicare, rather than the average commercial rate. For states that cover the Medicaid expansion population, payment is limited to 100% of the Medicare rate; for other states, payment is limited to 110% of the Medicare rate.</p><p>Subchapter D--Increasing Personal Accountability</p><p>(Sec. 71119) This section requires, beginning not later than the first quarter after December 31, 2026 (or earlier, at the option of the state), individuals who are eligible for Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population to engage in community service, work, or other activities in order to qualify for Medicaid.</p><p>Specifically, the section requires these individuals to, on a monthly basis, (1) work at least 80 hours, (2) complete at least 80 hours of community service, (3) participate in a work program for at least 80 hours, (4) be enrolled at least half-time in an educational program, or (5) engage in any combination thereof for a total of at least 80 hours. Individuals may also qualify if they have a monthly income (or, for seasonal workers, an average monthly income over six months) that is at least as much as the equivalent of minimum wage multiplied by 80 hours.</p><p>Individuals who are applying for Medicaid must demonstrate compliance with these requirements for one to three months (as determined by the state) consecutively and immediately prior to filing an application; individuals who are already enrolled in Medicaid must demonstrate compliance for one month or more (as determined by the state), whether or not consecutive, during the period between the individual’s last eligibility determination and the next scheduled eligibility determination.&nbsp;</p><p>States must verify an individual’s compliance upon a determination or redetermination of eligibility but may also choose to verify compliance more frequently. States may not waive the new requirements. However, states may choose to provide an exception for individuals experiencing short-term hardships (e.g., hospitalization).</p><p>The section excludes certain individuals from these requirements, including those with serious medical conditions or with dependent children aged 13 or younger.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon request, the CMS may exempt a state from fully implementing these requirements until December 31, 2028. States requesting an exemption must demonstrate good faith efforts to comply with the requirements and provide a detailed timeline for implementation.</p><p>The section provides $200 million to states and $200 million to the CMS for FY2026 to implement these requirements.</p><p>(Sec. 71120) This section requires, beginning in FY2029, states to institute cost-sharing requirements for individuals who are eligible for Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population and whose family income exceeds the federal poverty line. Cost sharing may not exceed $35 for an item or service; total cost sharing for all individuals in a family may not exceed 5% of the family’s income.&nbsp;</p><p>The requirements do not apply to (1) services for which cost sharing is already prohibited (e.g., emergency services); (2) primary care, mental health, or substance use disorder services; or (3) services provided by federally qualified health centers, certified community behavioral health clinics, or rural health clinics. States may allow providers to condition the provision of services upon the payment of any required cost sharing.</p><p>The section provides $15 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.</p><p>Subchapter E--Expanding Access to Care</p><p>(Sec. 71121) This section authorizes additional home and community-based services (HCBS) waivers (also known as Section 1915(c) waivers) for state Medicaid programs beginning on July 1, 2028. States may seek waivers to provide HCBS to individuals without the need for certain determinations as to whether an individual requires hospital or institutional care (as is required for current waivers). States must establish other needs-based criteria for such services.</p><p>The section provides $50 million for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions. It also provides $100 million for FY2027 to support state HCBS programs.</p><p>Chapter 2--Medicare</p><p>Subchapter A--Strengthening Eligibility Requirements</p><p>(Sec. 71201) This section generally restricts Medicare eligibility to U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, Cuban-Haitian entrants, and Compact of Free Association migrants lawfully residing in the United States. The SSA must identify Medicare enrollees who do not meet these requirements and terminate their enrollment within 18 months of this section’s enactment.</p><p>Current law authorizes additional categories of individuals who are lawfully present in the United States to qualify for Medicare, including refugees; noncitizens granted parole for at least one year, asylum, or related relief; noncitizens with Temporary Protected Status; and noncitizens with deferred action, including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients. The section excludes these individuals from eligibility.</p><p>(Sec. 71202) This section increases payments under the Medicare physician fee schedule for services furnished between January 1, 2026, and January 1, 2027.</p><p>Subchapter B--Improving Services for Seniors</p><p>(Sec. 71203) This section modifies certain provisions under the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program with respect to orphan drugs, including by excluding additional orphan drugs from qualifying for negotiation.</p><p>The Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program requires the CMS to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs under Medicare beginning in 2026. Among other requirements, drugs must have had market approval for at least 7 years (for drug products) or 11 years (for biologics) to qualify for negotiation. The program does not apply to orphan drugs that are approved to treat only one rare disease or condition.</p><p>The section modifies these provisions so as to exclude any period in which a drug was an orphan drug from market approval calculations. It also excludes orphan drugs that are approved to treat more than one rare disease or condition from the program. The changes take effect in 2028.</p><p>Chapter 3--Health Tax</p><p>Subchapter A-- Improving Eligibility Criteria</p><p>This subchapter modifies eligibility and verification requirements for the premium tax credit (which may be used to purchase health insurance on an exchange).</p><p>Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.</p><p>(Sec. 71301) This section limits a lawfully-present alien’s eligibility for the premium tax credit to</p><ul><li>an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence;</li><li>an alien who has been granted the status of Cuban and Haitian entrant; or</li><li>an individual who is lawfully residing in the United States in accordance with the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and&nbsp;Palau.</li></ul><p>(Sec. 71302) This section repeals the rule that allows certain lawfully-present aliens who have a household income of less than 100% of the federal poverty level and are ineligible for Medicaid (based on the individual’s alien status) to claim the premium tax credit.</p><p>Subchapter B--Preventing Waste, Fraud, and Abuse</p><p>This subchapter requires verification of certain information supplied by individuals for purposes of determining eligibility for the premium tax credit, limits use of the premium tax credit, and expands recapture of excess advance payments of the premium tax credit.</p><p>Below is a summary of the provisions of this subchapter.</p><p>(Sec. 71303) This section requires the verification, beginning in 2028, of certain information for an individual to enroll in a health insurance plan through a health insurance exchange and to generally qualify for the premium tax credit. (Under current law, eligible individuals are allowed a premium tax credit, which applies toward the cost of obtaining health insurance through health insurance exchanges.)</p><p>Specifically, under this section, a health insurance exchange must verify, using applicable enrollment information provided (or verified) by an individual,&nbsp;the following information:</p><ul><li>household income and family size,</li><li>whether the individual is an eligible alien,</li><li>any health coverage status or eligibility for coverage,</li><li>place of residence, and</li><li>any other information required by the Department of the Treasury.</li></ul><p>The verification requirements may be waived for individuals who enroll in a health insurance plan through a health insurance exchange during a special enrollment period due to a change in family size.</p><p>(Sec. 71304) This section provides that the premium tax credit is not allowed for any health insurance plan enrolled in through a health insurance exchange during a special enrollment period provided by such exchange (1) on the basis of the relationship between the individual’s expected household income to the federal poverty level, and (2) not in connection with with the occurrence of an event or change in circumstances specified by the Department of Health and Human Services for such purposes.</p><p>(Sec. 71305) This section eliminates the limit on the recapture of excess advance payments of the premium tax credit and, accordingly, allows the full amount of any such excess payments to be recaptured. (Under current law, individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level may be required to pay back only a portion of any excess advance payment of the premium tax credit.)</p><p>Subchapter C--Enhancing Choice for Patients</p><p>This subchapter expands health savings account (HSA) eligibility requirements.</p><p>As background, individuals may establish and contribute to an HSA if they are covered under a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) and not covered under a health plan that (1) is not an HDHP and (2) provides coverage for any benefits that is covered under the HDHP (subject to certain exceptions).</p><p>Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.</p><p>(Sec. 71306) This section allows individuals to establish and make tax-deductible contributions to a health savings account (HSA) if covered by a health insurance plan that provides telehealth and other remote care services without requiring a deductible but otherwise meets the requirements of an HDHP.</p><p>(Sec. 71307) This section expands eligibility to make tax-deductible HSA contributions to include individuals who have a bronze-level or catastrophic health insurance plan through a health insurance exchange.&nbsp;(A bronze-level health insurance plan provided through a health insurance exchange may or may not qualify as a HDHP, depending on the specific plan features. Catastrophic health plans provided through a health insurance exchange generally do not meet the requirements of a HDHP.)</p><p>(Sec. 71308) This section expands eligibility to make tax-deductible HSA contributions to include individuals who have a direct primary care service arrangement with a fixed period fee that does not exceed $150 a month (or $300 a month if the arrangement covers more than one individual). The amounts are adjusted annually for inflation. (Some limitations apply.)</p><p>Chapter 4--Protecting Rural Hospitals and Providers</p><p>(Sec. 71401) This section provides $10 billion per fiscal year for FY2026-FY2030 for a program that supports the provision of health care in rural areas.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the program, states may apply for financial allotments to improve the access and quality of care of services in rural areas, such as through enhanced technology, strategic partnerships, and workforce training. States must submit detailed rural health transformation plans and certify that no funds will be used to finance the non-federal share of Medicaid or CHIP. The CMS must approve or deny applications by December 31, 2025; states that receive approval do not need to reapply each year. States are not required to contribute any matching funds with respect to program allotments.</p><p>The CMS must award allotments so that 50% of funds are awarded equally among all approved states. The remaining 50% of funds must be awarded based on certain considerations, including the proportion of rural health facilities in the state compared to the number of such facilities nationwide.</p><p>The section additionally provides $200 million for FY2025 for the CMS to implement the program.&nbsp;</p><p>Subtitle C--Increase in Debt Limit</p><p>(Sec. 72001) This section increases the statutory debt limit by $5 trillion. (The debt limit is the amount of money that the Department of the Treasury may borrow to fund federal operations.)</p><p>Subtitle D--Unemployment</p><p>(Sec. 73001) This section prohibits payments under federal unemployment programs to individuals whose wages are $1 million or more. Such programs must include a method for individuals to certify that their income does not exceed this limit. State agencies that administer such programs must verify income information, to the extent possible, and provide for the recovery of any overpayments.&nbsp;</p><p>TITLE VIII--COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS</p><p>This title makes various changes to higher education, particularly to the federal student loan system.</p><p>Subtitle A--Exemption of Certain Assets</p><p>(Sec. 80001) This section exempts the assets of certain family farms, family-owned small businesses, and family-owned commercial fishing businesses from the information reported on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form.</p><p>This exemption applies to the net worth of (1) a family farm on which the family resides, (2) a small business with not more than 100 full-time or full-time equivalent employees that is owned and controlled by the family, or (3) a commercial fishing business and related expenses (e.g., fishing vessels and permits) owned and controlled by the family.</p><p>Prior to recent changes made to the FAFSA, the net worth of these family farms and family-owned small businesses were excluded as assets when calculating a student's financial need to determine federal student aid eligibility. Beginning with the 2024-2025 academic year, the net worth of these farms and businesses are treated as an asset and therefore included in the calculation. This section (1) restores the exemption to exclude the net worth of these family farms and family-owned small businesses from the calculation, and (2) expands the exemption to exclude the net worth of family-owned commercial fisheries from the calculation.</p><p>Subtitle B--Loan Limits</p><p>This subtitle makes various changes to federal student loans.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 81001)&nbsp;This section revises the types of federal student loans available to borrowers under the Direct Loan program and the borrowing limits for these loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The section terminates the ability of graduate or professional students to receive Direct PLUS Loans (i.e., Grad PLUS Loans) beginning on July 1, 2026.</p><p>The section revises the annual and aggregate limits an individual may borrow in Direct Loans. In particular, the section establishes the aggregate loan limit for Direct Unsubsidized Loans as $100,000 for a graduate student (in addition to the amount borrowed for undergraduate education) and $200,000 for a professional student (in addition to the amount borrowed for undergraduate education).</p><p>The section also places certain restrictions on Parent PLUS Loans beginning on July 1, 2026. In particular, the section sets an annual loan limit of $20,000 that may be borrowed on behalf of a dependent undergraduate student and a lifetime borrowing limit of $65,000 per dependent undergraduate student.</p><p>The section also institutes new maximum aggregate limits for borrowers beginning on July 1, 2026. For example, the section sets an overall aggregate lifetime borrowing limit of $257,500 for any single borrower across federal loan types (except for Parent PLUS Loans).</p><p>The section provides an exception to the loan limits described in this section (of up to three academic years) for a student who is already enrolled in a program of study and received a loan for the program.</p><p>The section also&nbsp;requires that a student's loan amount for an academic year be prorated based on their enrollment intensity if the student is enrolled on a less-than-full-time basis.</p><p>The section allows institutions of higher education (IHEs) to set lower loan limits&nbsp;if the limit is applied consistently to all students enrolled in the program.</p><p>Subtitle C--Loan Repayment</p><p>This subtitle revises loan repayment options for federal student loans.</p><p>(Sec. 82001) This section terminates all current student loan repayment plans for new loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2026.</p><p>The Department of Education (ED) may only offer borrowers two options for repayment of federal student loans: a standard repayment plan (with the length of the repayment term determined by the total amount borrowed) and an income-based repayment plan (to be known as the Repayment Assistance Plan, or RAP). Consequently, borrowers with new loans made on or after July 1, 2026, are limited to these two repayment plans.</p><p>Beginning on July 1, 2028, a borrower with a loan that is in a repayment status in accordance with, or an administrative forbearance associated with, an income-contingent repayment plan must begin repaying the loan under a new repayment plan. This applies to current borrowers who are on the following repayment plans: (1) the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, (2) the Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plan, or (3) the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan. If a borrower does not select a plan, ED must enroll the borrower in either the RAP or the standard repayment plan.</p><p>(Sec. 82002) This section eliminates economic hardship and unemployment deferments for borrowers who receive a federal student loan on or after July 1, 2027. A borrower who receives a loan on or after July 1, 2027, may only be eligible for a discretionary forbearance for no more than 9 months during a 24-month period.</p><p>(Sec. 82003) This section allows borrowers to rehabilitate a defaulted loan twice (currently, only once). However, beginning on July 1, 2027, the borrower must pay a minimum payment amount of $10.</p><p>(Sec. 82004) This section allows payments under the new RAP to count as qualifying payments for purposes of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.</p><p>(Sec. 82005) This section provides funding to ED for administrative costs, including for the costs of student loan servicing.</p><p>Subtitle D--Pell Grants</p><p>This subtitle makes changes to Pell Grants.</p><p>(Sec. 83001) This section requires foreign income that is exempt from taxation or foreign income for which an individual receives a foreign tax credit to be included in the adjusted gross income calculation for purposes of calculating eligibility for Pell Grants.</p><p>Students with a student aid index (SAI) that equals or exceeds twice the amount of the total maximum Pell Grant are ineligible for Pell Grants, regardless of their adjusted gross income.&nbsp;(The SAI is a formula-based index number that represents a student's level of financial need. It is calculated using information that the student provides on the FAFSA form.)</p><p>The section’s changes take effect beginning on July 1, 2026.</p><p>(Sec. 83002) This section requires ED to award Workforce Pell Grants to students enrolled in eligible workforce programs.

Specifically, the section prohibits an IHE from using federal funds for student enrollment in low-earning outcome programs. Low-earning outcome programs are educational programs in which the graduating cohort of students earn less as working adults compared to those with lesser degrees (e.g., a high school diploma instead of a bachelor's degree).</p><p>If an educational program does not meet the median earning requirements, the IHE must promptly notify each student enrolled in the program.</p><p>ED must establish a process for an IHE with an educational program that has lost eligibility for federal funds to be able to apply to regain eligibility for such funds.</p><p>IHEs must comply with these requirements beginning on July 1, 2026.</p><p>Subtitle F--Regulatory Relief</p><p>(Sec. 85001) This section delays until July 1, 2035, ED regulations pertaining to borrower defense to repayment.

(Under closed school discharge regulations, a borrower's liability to repay a federal student loan is discharged if the borrower&nbsp;does not complete the program of study for which the loan was made because the school the borrower attended has closed.) For loans that first originated before July 1, 2035, the section restores those regulations that were in effect prior to changes made in November 2022.
