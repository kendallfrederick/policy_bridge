(The shortfall amortization charge for a plan for any plan year is the aggregate total of the shortfall amortization installments in amortizing unfunded liabilities for such plan year with respect to the shortfall amortization bases for the plan year and each of the six preceding plan years. Shortfall amortization installments are the amounts necessary to amortize the shortfall amortization base of the plan for any plan year in level annual installments over the seven-plan-year period beginning with such plan year.)</p> <p>Allows a sponsor of a single-employer defined benefit pension plan to elect in any two plan years 2008-2011 extended amortization periods (of 9 or 15 years instead of the usual 7 years).</p> <p>Requires an increase in alternate required shortfall amortization installments by an installment acceleration amount, during a specified restriction period (beginning after December 31, 2009), in cases of excess compensation or extraordinary dividends or stock redemptions, as determined according to specified formulae.

Requires adjustments, after 2014 and after 2018, of the initial and final premium percentages to reflect the excess (if any) of the rate of premium growth over the rate of growth of income and the consumer price index. <p>Reduces from 9.8% to 9.5% of a taxpayer's household income the maximum amount an employee's required contribution to an employer-sponsored plan may be for such employee to be treated as eligible for employer-sponsored minimum essential coverage.</p> <p>Increases the percentage of employer cost sharing for the out-of-pocket expenses of individuals with household incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty line.</p> <p>(Sec. 1002) Revises the provisions setting forth penalties to be imposed on individuals who decline to purchase health care coverage by: (1) lowering the maximum penalty amount from $495 to $325 in 2015 and from $750 to $695 in 2016; and (2) increasing the penalty rates based on taxpayer household income for taxable years beginning in 2014 and 2015 and for taxable years beginning after 2015.</p> <p>(Sec. 1003) Revises the provisions setting forth penalties to be imposed on employers with 50 or more employees who decline to offer employees health care coverage to allow an exemption for the first 30 employees (including part-time employees) when calculating the penalty.

(Generally, a subsection [d] hospital is an acute care hospital, particularly one that receives payments under Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system [IPPS] when providing covered inpatient services to eligible beneficiaries.)</p> <p>Advances the beginning of such reductions from FY2015 to FY2014.

Outlines conditions under which a loan guarantee may be entered for such purposes, including that the guarantee is for an activity that supports the production or supply of an industrial resource, critical technology item, or other material essential for national defense purposes. Requires that, if the making of any loan guarantee relating to a domestic industrial base shortfall would cause the aggregate outstanding amount of all guarantees for such shortfall to exceed $50 million, such guarantee may be made only if the President notifies the congressional finance committees of the proposed guarantee and 30 days have elapsed.
