The compacts are the agreements that govern the relationship of the United States with the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), and the Republic of Palau, collectively referred to as the Freely Associated States (FAS). The title also addresses other issues related to the FAS, including by authorizing various U.S. assistance to the FAS. </p> <p>(Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau are sovereign states that, through the Compacts of Free Association, receive U.S. economic assistance and allow the United States to operate military bases in their territory. Citizens of the FAS have the right to work and reside in the United States and may serve in the U.S. Armed Forces.)</p> <p>(Sec. 204) This section provides congressional approval for (1) the 2023 Agreement to Amend the U.S.-FSM Compact, (2) the 2023 U.S.-FSM Trust Fund Agreement, (3) the 2023 Agreement to Amend the U.S.-RMI Compact, (4) the 2023 U.S.-RMI Trust Fund Agreement, (5) and the 2023 U.S.-Palau Compact Review Agreement.

For example, any amendment or termination of the amended Compacts of Free Association may not enter into force until Congress has incorporated the change in an act. Any changes to subsidiary agreements may not enter into force until 90 days after the President has reported certain information to Congress.</p> <p>(Sec. 205) This section addresses issues relating to provisions in the amended U.S.-FSM Compact, the agreement between the United States and Micronesia. </p> <p>The U.S. government must provide nonreimbursable technical and training assistance, as appropriate, to enable the government of Micronesia to (1) develop and adequately enforce its own laws, and (2) cooperate with U.S. efforts to enforce U.S. laws.</p> <p>This section also addresses issues related to U.S. appointees to various committees established by the amended agreement, including the term lengths and qualifications of such appointees.</p> <p>(Sec. 206) This section addresses issues related to provisions in the amended U.S.-RMI Compact, the agreement between the United States and the Marshall Islands. </p> <p>The U.S. government must provide nonreimbursable technical and training assistance, as appropriate, to enable the government of the Marshall Islands to (1) develop and adequately enforce its own laws, and (2) cooperate with U.S. efforts to enforce U.S. laws.</p> <p>The Department of the Interior (Interior) may provide grants to the government of the Marshall Islands to carry out a planting and agricultural maintenance program on Bikini, Enewetak, Rongelap, and Utrik.

The GAO must periodically report to Congress on various topics about each of the FAS, such as the (1) general social, political, and economic conditions; (2) use and effectiveness of U.S. assistance; and (3) status of economic policy reforms. </p> <p>The section provides authorities to Interior and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to fulfill responsibilities for monitoring and managing funds related to the FAS.</p> <p>The President must establish an Interagency Group on Freely Associated States to (1) coordinate the development and implementation of activities related to the FAS, and (2) provide recommendations and oversight to federal agencies with respect to the agreements. </p> <p>This section also reaffirms that the foreign loans or debt of the governments of the FAS do not constitute an obligation of the United States, and that the full faith and credit of the U.S. government shall not apply to such loans or debt without specific further authorization. </p> <p>(Sec. 209) This section addresses U.S. activities in the FAS, including medical care for veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces and grants related to education.</p> <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may furnish hospital care and medical services in the FAS to a veteran who is otherwise eligible to receive such care and services. Such care and services may be provided for any condition even if the condition is not connected to the veteran's service. Before providing the care and services, the VA must enter into agreements with the governments of the FAS regarding various issues, including the licensure and certification of the health care personnel providing the care and services. </p> <p>The VA may also pay the travel expenses of an individual to travel to, from, or within the FAS to receive such hospital care and medical services.</p> <p>The VA may also continue to provide medical care and travel benefits to a veteran who received such care and services regardless of whether the country continues to qualify as an FAS. </p> <p>Subject to the availability of appropriations, the VA must conduct outreach to and engage with each government of the FAS and increase staffing as necessary to conduct such outreach. </p> <p>This section also requires the U.S. government to continue to make available to the FAS certain education-related grants and assistance, including grants under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, to the extent such grants continue to be available in the United States. For certain grant programs that are currently available to one or some of the FAS, such as certain assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (currently available to Palau), the United States must continue to offer such assistance and make such assistance available in Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. </p> <p>Other than the grants specifically named in this section, the Department of Education may not provide a grant under any formula grant program to the FAS.</p> <p>This section also extends the Head Start program to Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. (The Head Start program provides comprehensive early childhood education and development services for low-income children. Currently, the program operates in the 50 states, five territories, and Palau.) </p> <p>The Department of Defense must make its medical facilities in the FAS available for use by the citizens of the FAS if the individual has received a referral from the relevant government.</p> <p>Interior must provide training for judges and judiciary officials in the FAS. </p> <p>The Department of Health and Human Services must make National Health Service Corps services available to the residents of the FAS to the same extent and for the same duration as the services are authorized for individuals residing in any other areas within or outside the United States. </p> <p>Palau shall be eligible for certain programs currently available to Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, such as programs provided by the Small Business Administration and the Economic Development Administration. Palau shall also be eligible for services provided by the Legal Services Corporation, the Public Health Service, and the Rural Housing Service.</p> <p>This section also relaxes requirements related to federal public benefits for FAS citizens who lawfully reside in the United States. For example, many non-U.S. nationals (<i>aliens</i> under federal law) are generally not eligible for federal means-tested benefits for five years starting from when the individual entered the United States. Current law provides an exception for FAS citizens who lawfully reside in the United States to receive Medicaid without this five-year waiting period. This section expands this exception to allow FAS citizens to receive other federal means-tested public benefits without the waiting period. </p> <p>The Department of the Treasury must consult with the Asian Development Bank and relevant international financial institutions concerning assistance to the FAS.</p> <p>The Department of State must establish a unit with the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs to address issues relating to the FAS, including managing relationships with the FAS.</p> <p>(Sec. 210) This section establishes that appropriations for certain activities required by the Compacts of Free Association shall be made directly to the federal agencies carrying out the activities. The section also establishes that certain assistance provided under the agreements shall be in addition to other amounts to be paid to Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.</p> <p>(Sec. 211) This section provides funding for FY2024-FY2043 for various activities related to the FAS.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has <a href=""https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-05/hr3746_Letter_McCarthy.pdf"">estimated</a> that the spending limits will reduce spending below the levels included in its baseline projections. </p> <p>In addition, this section extends and establishes new limits for several adjustments to discretionary spending limits that are permitted under current law to accommodate additional appropriations for certain activities. These adjustments apply to spending for </p> <ul> <li> continuing disability reviews and redeterminations, </li> <li> health care fraud and abuse control, and </li> <li> reemployment services and eligibility assessments.</li> </ul> <p>The section also extends the adjustment to discretionary spending limits for disaster relief funding. The limits for this adjustment are based on a statutory formula, which is modified by this section. </p> <p>During FY2026-FY2029, if the annual budget resolution has not been adopted by Congress by April 15, this section requires the chairman of the House Budget Committee to submit to the House a spending allocation for the House Appropriations Committee that is consistent with levels specified in this section. </p> <p>Finally, the section provides funding for (1) the Department of Veterans Affairs Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, and (2) the Department of Commerce Nonrecurring Expenses Fund. </p> <p>(Sec. 102) This section requires the discretionary spending limits to be revised if a continuing resolution (CR) is in effect at the beginning of the calendar year. </p> <p>Specifically, if a CR for FY2024 or FY2025 is in effect on or after January 1 of 2024 or 2025 for any discretionary budget account, the discretionary spending limits for that fiscal year must be revised to specified levels. CBO has <a href=""https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-05/hr3746_Letter_McCarthy.pdf"">estimated</a> that the revised limits will be lower for defense spending and higher for nondefense spending compared to the original limits. </p> <p>If all of the regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year are enacted before April 30, the revised limits revert to the original limits. If a CR is in effect on April 30 of 2024 or 2025, a final sequestration order must be issued based on the revised limits. </p> <p>(Sec. 103) This section exempts specified funds that were previously designated as emergency spending from the discretionary spending limits. </p> <p>TITLE II--BUDGET ENFORCEMENT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES </p> <p>(Sec. 111) This section requires the chairman of the House Budget Committee to submit for publication in the Congressional Record FY2024 committee allocations, aggregate spending levels, and aggregate revenue levels consistent with this division. </p> <p>The allocations, aggregates, and levels submitted by the chairman are enforceable in the House of Representatives as if they were included in a FY2024 congressional budget resolution. </p> <p>The chairman may adjust the levels to reflect (1) changes resulting from CBO's updates to it baseline for FY2024-FY2033, or (2) legislation that would not increase the deficit over either FY2024-FY2028 or FY2024-FY2033. </p> <p>This section expires if Congress agrees to a budget resolution for FY2024. </p> <p>(Sec. 112) This section sets forth limitations that apply to advance appropriations in the House of Representatives. </p> <p>(Sec. 113) This section specifies that this title is enacted under the rulemaking powers of the House of Representatives and will be considered part of the rules of the House. It also recognizes that the House has the authority to change these rules. </p> <p>TITLE III--BUDGET ENFORCEMENT IN THE SENATE </p> <p>(Sec. 121) This section requires the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to submit for publication in the Congressional Record FY2024 committee allocations, aggregate spending and revenue levels, and levels of Social Security revenues and outlays consistent with this division. The chairman may also include the deficit neutral reserve fund contained in the FY2022 budget resolution, updated by two fiscal years. </p> <p>The allocations, aggregates, and levels submitted by the chairman are enforceable in the Senate as if they were included in a FY2024 congressional budget resolution. This section expires if Congress agrees to a budget resolution for FY2024. </p> <p>(Sec. 122) After April 15, 2024, but not later than May 15, 2024, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee must submit for publication in the Congressional Record FY2025 committee allocations, aggregate spending and revenue levels, and levels of Social Security revenues and outlays consistent with this division. The chairman may also include the deficit neutral reserve fund contained in the FY2022 budget resolution, updated by three fiscal years. </p> <p>After April 15, 2024, the allocations, aggregates, and levels submitted by the chairman are enforceable in the Senate as if they were included in a FY2025 congressional budget resolution. This section expires if Congress agrees to a budget resolution for FY2025. </p> <p>(Sec. 123) This section sets forth limitations and budget enforcement procedures that apply to advance appropriations in the Senate. </p> <p>(Sec. 124) This section specifies that this title is enacted under the rulemaking powers of the Senate and will be considered part of the rules of the Senate. It also recognizes that the Senate has the authority to change these rules. </p> <p> DIVISION B--SAVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS</p> <p>TITLE I--RESCISSION OF UNOBLIGATED FUNDS </p> <p>This title rescinds

Act of 2022). </p> <p>TITLE III--STATUTORY ADMINISTRATIVE PAY-AS-YOU-GO</p> <p><i>Administrative Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2023</i></p> <p>This title provides statutory authority for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administrative pay-as-you-go procedures.</p> <p>(Sec. 263) This section requires federal agencies to submit at least one proposal to reduce direct spending (i.e., mandatory spending) before taking a discretionary administrative action that increases direct spending. The proposed reduction must be greater than or equal to the increase in direct spending attributable to the administrative action.</p> <p>Further, if an agency determines an administrative action that increases direct spending is required by law, and therefore not subject to these requirements, the agency must submit to the OMB (1) its legal basis for concluding that the action is not discretionary, and (2) the projected increase in direct spending under the least costly implementation option that is reasonably identifiable.</p> <p>(Sec. 264) This section requires the OMB to issue administrative guidance regarding these requirements. </p> <p>(Sec. 265) This section permits the OMB to waive these requirements if a waiver is necessary for (1) the delivery of essential services, or (2) effective program delivery. </p> <p>(Sec. 266) This section exempts administrative actions from these requirements if the direct spending cost of the action is less than (1) $1 billion over the 10-year period beginning with the current year, or (2) $100 million in any given year over such period. </p> <p>(Sec. 267) Determinations, findings, and actions related to these requirements are not subject to judicial review. </p> <p>(Sec. 268) These requirements expire on December 31, 2024. </p> <p>(Sec. 269) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) must report on the implementation of these requirements. </p> <p>(Sec. 270) The GAO also must include an assessment of an agency's compliance with these requirements in its report for a major rule under the Congressional Review Act. </p> <p>TITLE IV--TERMINATION OF SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS ON FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS; RESUMPTION OF ACCRUAL OF INTEREST AND COLLECTIONS </p> <p>(Sec. 271) This section terminates the suspension of (1) federal student loan payments, (2) the application of a 0% interest rate on these loans, and (3) involuntary collections on these loans. This termination takes effect 60 days after June 30, 2023. </p> <p>The section also prohibits the Department of Education from implementing any executive action or rule that extends any of these suspensions unless the action is expressly authorized by Congress. </p> <p>DIVISION C--GROW THE ECONOMY </p> <p>TITLE I--TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE TO NEEDY FAMILIES </p> <p>This title makes various changes to the work requirements and other aspects of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. </p> <p>(Sec. 301) This section changes the comparison year for calculating the caseload reduction credit from FY2005 to FY2015. Under current law, states must meet a mandatory work participation rate by ensuring that a specified percentage of families that receive TANF assistance participate in work-related activities. However, a state may earn a caseload reduction credit to lower that rate by reducing its caseload of families receiving TANF assistance as compared to its caseload in FY2005. This section changes the comparison year to FY2015. </p> <p>(Sec. 302) This section requires the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants to up to five states for piloting alternative ways to measure the states' performance in improving employment and earnings outcomes and other indicators of family stability and well-being for TANF recipients. </p> <p>(Sec. 303) This section restricts a practice whereby some states provide a limited amount of TANF assistance to families as a supplement to benefits that the families receive under another program, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and then count those families when determining the work participation rate. </p> <p>Specifically, the section requires that states must provide those families with a benefit of at least $35 per month (funded with state expenditures) in order to count the families when determining the work participation rate. </p> <p>(Sec. 304) This section requires states to report metrics related to the employment and educational outcomes of individuals who exit the TANF program. Specifically, states must report on the employment rate for individuals in unsubsidized employment following their exit from the program and their median earnings. Additionally, states must report on the percentage of individuals under age 24 who obtain a high school degree or equivalent while in the TANF program or within a year of their exit. </p> <p>(Sec. 305) This section makes the changes to the TANF program generally effective on October 1, 2024. However, changes affecting the caseload reduction credit and the provision of limited TANF assistance are effective on October 1, 2025. </p> <p>TITLE II--SNAP EXEMPTIONS </p> <p>(Sec. 311) This section expands applicability of the work requirements for SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs). (SNAP recipients who are ABAWDs have work-related requirements in addition to the general SNAP work registration and employment and training requirements.) </p> <p>Specifically, this section applies the work requirements for ABAWDs to adults who are</p> <ul> <li>not over 51 years old in FY2023, </li> <li> not over 53 years old in FY2024, and </li> <li> not over 55 years old in FY2025 and every year thereafter. </li> </ul> <p>Under current law, these requirements apply to adults who are not over 50 years old. These provisions go into effect 90 days after enactment and sunset on October 1, 2030. </p> <p>Also, the section exempts from the ABAWD work requirements homeless individuals, veterans, and certain individuals who were previously in foster care and are 24 years old or younger. </p> <p>(Sec. 312) This section prohibits a state agency from accumulating unused exemptions to the ABAWD work requirement and providing them to eligible SNAP recipients beyond the subsequent fiscal year.</p> <p> Currently, for each fiscal year, a state agency may exempt a certain number of SNAP recipients from the ABAWD work requirements; unused exemptions may be carried over and used in a subsequent fiscal year. Under this section, an unused exemption may not be carried over for more than one year. </p> <p>Further, this section reduces the percentage of exemptions a state agency may provide each year so that the average monthly number of exemptions does not exceed 8% of covered individuals (i.e., SNAP recipients and certain individuals who were denied SNAP benefits due to the work requirements). Under current law, a state is eligible for exemptions for up to 12% of covered individuals.</p> <p>These provisions apply to FY2024 and each subsequent fiscal year. </p> <p>(Sec. 313) This section expands the purpose of SNAP to include assisting low-income adults in obtaining employment and increasing their earnings. </p> <p>(Sec. 314) This section requires USDA to make public all available state requests for waivers from the SNAP ABAWD work requirements and the approvals of the requests within 30 days of enactment; this includes making public all supporting data from the state about the request and relevant documentation on the utilization of waivers. </p> <p>This waiver program allows the Food and Nutrition Service to provide a state exemptions from SNAP ABAWD work requirements based on a determination that an area (1) has an unemployment rate of over 10%, or (2) does not have a sufficient number of jobs. </p> <p>TITLE III--PERMITTING REFORM </p> <p>(Sec. 321) This section modifies provisions under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), including by limiting the scope of the administrative review of major federal actions. Under NEPA, agencies must conduct an environmental assessment (EA) to determine if a proposed federal action will have significant environmental impacts. If the EA determines that such impacts will be significant, then the agency must submit an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The EIS must include a range of alternatives to the proposed action. </p> <p>Among other elements, the section defines a<i> major federal action</i> to be an action that an agency determines is subject to substantial federal control and responsibility. The definition explicitly excludes certain actions from NEPA requirements, such as a nonfederal action with minimal federal funding or involvement. </p> <p>This section limits the scope of an EIS review to reasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed agency action. The section also provides threshold determinations for when an agency is not required to prepare an environmental document under NEPA, such as when categorical exclusions (including those adopted from another agency) apply.</p> <p>The section limits alternatives in an EIS to a reasonable range. Further, the alternatives included in the EIS must be technically and economically feasible. Additionally, an EA or EIS must also be under the page limits established by the section. </p> <p>The section also requires a lead agency to be designated when more than one agency is participating in a proposed action. The lead agency must supervise the preparation of one environmental document (e.g., EIS) and prepare a schedule to complete the review of the action. </p> <p>The lead agency must complete the EA or EIS within deadlines established by the section but may extend the deadline to provide additional time as is necessary. Additionally, a project sponsor may file a written petition to seek a court order to set forth a schedule and deadline for the agency if the agency has failed to act. </p> <p>A lead agency must prescribe procedures to allow a project sponsor to prepare an EA or EIS under the supervision of the agency. </p> <p>The section also provides guidelines for the (1) use of analysis from a previously reviewed programmatic environmental document in a subsequent document for a specified time period, and (2) adoption of another agency's categorical exclusions for proposed agency actions. </p> <p>Under this section, the Council on Environmental Quality must study and report on the potential for online and digital technologies to address delays in reviews and improve public accessibility and transparency related to NEPA requirements.</p> <p>(Sec. 322) This section requires the Electric Reliability Organization to study the total transfer capability between transmission planning regions.
