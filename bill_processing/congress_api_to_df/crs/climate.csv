R48258,2024-11-12T05:00:00Z,2025-06-21T04:40:48Z,Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR): Its Potential Role in Climate Change Mitigation,"Rising global temperatures are associated with increasingly frequent and intense climate change impacts. Scientific consensus finds that stabilizing global temperatures is necessary to avoid increased climate impacts. Studies suggest that such stabilization requires human-caused carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to be balanced by CO2 removals from the atmosphere, a condition known as net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. While reductions in human-caused emissions of CO2 would be necessary to stabilize global temperatures, they may not be sufficient. This is due in part to the difficulty in eliminating emissions from some key economic sectors that are harder to decarbonize, including the steel and cement industries. These emissions are likely to persist after a program of emissions reductions and are known as residual emissions. Methods of further removing CO2 from the atmosphere may be necessary to counterbalance residual emissions. Researchers are enhancing nature-based techniques for increasing the uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere by the land surface and oceans, known as carbon sinks, as well as with recently developed technological methods. These are known collectively as carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Almost all the climate scenarios assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that met specific global temperature stabilization levels used CDR to remove more CO2 from the atmosphere than is being added by emissions. CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas (GHG) with a climate effect. The influence of GHGs on global temperatures is the combined effect of CO2 and the other non-CO2 GHGs. Human-caused emissions of other GHGs—including methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)—also increase global temperatures. No commercially available method for removing non-CO2 GHGs from the atmosphere exists. Therefore, to balance emissions of non-CO2 GHGs that cannot be abated, additional removals of CO2 from the atmosphere would be needed.There are several types and categories of CDR. Some CDR methods increase the uptake of CO2 on land by increasing forested area or increasing carbon sequestered in soils. Other methods have been proposed that increase the uptake of CO2 by the oceans through biological or chemical methods. A third category of CDR uses engineering methods such as chemically capturing CO2 from the air or from the combustion of biofuel energy crops and storing it in geological formations.Although almost all climate scenarios find that CDR would be necessary to meet global temperature goals, some researchers have raised concerns about relying on CDR to stabilize global temperatures. These concerns include uncertainties about the effectiveness, feasibility, and side effects of the deployment of certain CDR approaches at a scale necessary for such stabilization. For example, with CDR using forestry or soil carbon enrichment, there is concern that carbon could return to the atmosphere through forest fires or changes in tillage practices. As another example, for forestry and biofuel CDR, there is concern that the land area needed could impinge on food production. The possible ecological side effects of enhancing ocean uptake of CO2 have also caused concern. At the same time, researchers have noted potential co-benefits associated with certain CDR approaches, including improved crop production through increased levels of soil organic matter and reductions in ocean acidification through changes in ocean alkalinity. Laws enacted in the 117th Congress included funding for federal CDR research and development. For example, the 117th Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA; P.L. 117-58), the CHIPS Act of 2022 (P.L. 117-167), and the measure commonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA; P.L. 117-169). Legislation to support the research, development, and implementation of CDR has been introduced in the 118th Congress. As the CDR programs and provisions supported by enacted legislation are implemented under congressional oversight, Congress may consider the future direction of federal CDR policy.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R48258/R48258.2.pdf
IF11696,2024-04-26T04:00:00Z,2025-06-21T03:32:16Z,"Aviation, Air Pollution, and Climate Change","Some Members of Congress have expressed interest in addressing air pollution emissions, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the climate change effects from domestic and international aviation. Recent legislative proposals would provide for sustainable fuel mandates, incentives for airport efficiency improvements, and GHG emission targets, among other requirements. Emissions from Aircraft The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that transportation—including passenger cars and light trucks, heavy-duty trucks, buses, trains, ships, and aircraft—accounted for 37% of carbon dioxide (CO2, the principal GHG) emissions in 2021. While CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light trucks exceed those from aircraft in the United States, CO2 emissions from aviation are currently experiencing a faster rate of growth. All aircraft, including military, commercial, and privately chartered, accounted for 11% of the U.S. transportation sector’s CO2 emissions and 4% of all U.S. CO2 emissions in 2021. Commercial aircraft, including those operated by passenger and all-cargo airlines, accounted for 7% of transportation sector and 3% of all emissions. These estimates include emissions from U.S. domestic flights and emissions from international flights departing the United States, referred to as “international bunkering.”In the United States, aggregate CO2 emissions from aircraft have fluctuated due to changes in technology, the economy, travel frequency, and military activity, among other reasons. However, since the global financial crisis in 2009, aggregate CO2 emissions from all aircraft types have grown steadily, increasing by almost 22% between 2009 and 2019. This increase makes aircraft one of the faster-growing sources of CO2 emissions in the U.S. transportation sector over the past decade. This trend was affected, at least temporarily, by reduced air travel in 2020 and 2021 due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The effects of aircraft emissions on the atmosphere are complex, reflecting differing altitudes, geography, time horizons, and environmental conditions. Research has shown that in addition to CO2 emissions, other factors increase the climate change impacts of aviation. These factors include the contribution of aircraft emissions to ozone production; the formation of water condensation trails and cirrus clouds; the emission of various gases and particles, including water vapor, nitrous oxides, sulfates, and particulates from jet fuel combustion; and the high altitude location of the bulk of these emissions. In examining the warming and cooling influences of these factors, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated aviation’s total climate change impact could be from two to four times that of its past CO2 emissions alone.Aside from GHG emissions, aircraft engines emit a number of criteria—or common—pollutants, including nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, oxides of sulfur, unburned or partially combusted hydrocarbons (also known as volatile organic compounds [VOCs]), particulates, and other trace compounds. A subset of the VOCs and particulates are considered hazardous air pollutants.Emission Reduction StrategiesIn an effort to reduce emissions from the aviation sector, the U.S. government, other nations, and international organizations have worked together with the aviation industry toward improving technologies, increasing the efficient use of aircraft and airport infrastructure, adopting appropriate economic incentives, and setting standards.Aircraft Emission Standards: Domestic ProcessIn the United States, in accordance with Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 231 (42 U.S.C. §7571), EPA sets emission levels for specified pollutants, as promulgated in 40 C.F.R. Part 87, “Control of Air Pollution from Aircraft and Aircraft Engines.” EPA sets standards for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-certified aircraft according to the amount of thrust generated by their engines. Aircraft emission standards currently exist for fuel venting, and engine hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides. In 2021, EPA promulgated standards for CO2 emissions from aircraft engines. In 2022, EPA finalized standards for particulate emissions from certain classes of engines used by civil subsonic jet aircraft (87 FR 72312). In 2023, EPA finalized an endangerment finding for lead pollution from gasoline-powered, piston-engine aircraft (88 FR 72372). With this final determination, EPA is required to propose and promulgate regulatory standards for lead emissions from aircraft engines.The standard-setting language under CAA Section 231 is similar to the statutory language for other mobile sources in the CAA (e.g., cars, trucks, buses). However, compared to other mobile sources, EPA must meet additional requirements in setting emission standards for aircraft and aircraft engines: (1) the EPA Administrator must consult with the Administrator of the FAA and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) in developing emission standards; (2) the EPA Administrator cannot change standards if doing so would “significantly increase noise and adversely affect safety”; and (3) the President may disapprove any such standards if the DOT Secretary finds that they “would create a hazard to aircraft safety.” CAA Section 232 requires the FAA to enforce the standards at the time an engine is certified for emissions under 14 C.F.R. Part 34, “Fuel Venting and Exhaust Emission Requirements for Turbine Engine Powered Airplanes.” Since compliance with the federal standards is determined at engine certification, there are no operational emissions regulations for aircraft.Aircraft Emission Standards: International ProcessDue to the global nature of the aircraft manufacturing industry and its customer base, EPA has generally regulated emissions from aircraft only after the United States has negotiated an international agreement through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). ICAO is a United Nations specialized agency established in 1944 to manage the administration and governance of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (the Chicago Convention). ICAO has 193 member states, including the United States. ICAO addresses civil aviation (i.e., all nonmilitary, private, and commercial aviation). ICAO’s activities regarding environmental protection focus on issues that could benefit most from an industry-wide coordinated approach—for example, aircraft noise and engine emissions. ICAO has no direct regulatory or enforcement authority. After member states agree to a negotiated set of international standards, they implement these standards through their own domestic laws and regulatory processes. Typically, ICAO’s international standards for pollutants from aircraft, unlike EPA’s regulations for the same pollutants from on-road vehicles, have consistently avoided technology-forcing requirements. For example, the most recent ICAO standards for nitrogen oxides essentially ratified what the principal aircraft manufacturers had already achieved. Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction StrategiesCO2 Emission Standards Since 2010, ICAO has negotiated with the aviation industry and selected stakeholders to develop international CO2 emission standards for aircraft engines. A delegation of EPA and FAA representatives have participated in ICAO’s process. In March 2017, ICAO adopted international CO2 standards for commercial aircraft engines to begin in 2020. The ICAO standards represent the world’s first global design certification measure governing CO2 emissions for any industry sector. The standards apply to newly developed civil aircraft designs phased-in between January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2023, and to in-production aircraft after January 1, 2028. They do not apply to already-manufactured aircraft that are currently in use. CO2 emissions targets vary by aircraft type and are set as a function of the aircraft’s maximum takeoff weight.In accordance with the ICAO negotiations and the CAA, EPA issued a finding that GHG emissions (including CO2 emissions) from civil aircraft contribute to the pollution that causes climate change and endangers U.S. public health and welfare (81 FR 54422). EPA’s endangerment finding, under Section 231 of the CAA, laid the necessary foundation for adoption and implementation of CO2 standards for U.S. aircraft, in consultation with FAA. On January 11, 2021, EPA promulgated GHG emission standards for aircraft engines equivalent to the CO2 standards adopted by the ICAO (86 FR 2136). The standards cover U.S. subsonic jet and propeller-driven aircraft above certain takeoff weights. Upon EPA’s promulgation of the rule, CAA Section 232 requires the FAA to issue regulations to enforce the standards and apply such standards when certifying the engines of U.S. aircraft manufacturers (87 FR 36076). EPA stated that the standards would make domestically manufactured aircraft engines competitive in the global marketplace; however, the agency also acknowledged that the rule likely would not spur any emissions reductions from U.S. aircraft manufacturers beyond their current trends.Market-Based Mechanisms In October 2016, ICAO also agreed on a framework for offsetting future carbon emissions from aviation—referred to as the Market-Based Mechanism, or MBM. ICAO member states agreed to implement a “Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to address any annual increase in total CO2 emissions from international civil aviation (i.e. civil aviation flights that depart in one country and arrive in a different country) above the 2020 levels, taking into account special circumstances and respective capabilities.” CORSIA relies on the use of emissions units from carbon markets to offset the amount of CO2 emissions that cannot be reduced through the use of sustainable aviation fuels or technological and operational improvements. CORSIA began in 2021. Compliance was to be measured against a baseline of CO2 emissions defined as the average from all international civil aviation in 2019 and 2020. However, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on international air travel in 2020, ICAO adopted a baseline based solely on 2019 emissions for a three-year pilot phase, and a baseline of 85% of 2019 emissions for the period 2024-2035.Participation in CORSIA is voluntary through 2026. The U.S. aviation industry agreed to participate during ICAO negotiations. To fulfill the U.S. commitments under the Chicago Convention with respect to the MBM, FAA implemented the CORSIA Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification Program in 2019 (84 FR 9412). Whether and what additional authorities are required by EPA and FAA to comply with CORSIA’s mandatory trading scheme beginning in 2027 is under consideration. Other Reduction StrategiesBeyond federal and international CO2 emission standards for aircraft engines, other policy options are available to reduce GHGs from the aviation sector. These include (1) taxes or fees on fuel or its carbon content; (2) incentives or mandates to use sustainable aviation fuels or fuel alternatives; (3) incentives to modernize air traffic control systems (see CRS In Focus IF11420, Aircraft Noise and Air Traffic Control Modernization); and (4) ground-based measures aimed at reducing GHG emissions from nonaircraft operations at airports. EPA and FAA administer several initiatives in operations and research, and collaborate at the national and international levels, in support of many of these policies.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IF/PDF/IF11696/IF11696.8.pdf
IF12433,2024-06-14T04:00:00Z,2025-06-21T03:45:54Z,"Automobiles, Air Pollution, and Climate Change","On August 5, 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 14037, “Strengthening American Leadership in Clean Cars and Trucks” (86 FR 43583). The order required, among other items, executive agencies to revisit and amend the federal standards that regulate air pollution emissions, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and fuel economy of new passenger cars and light trucks. These standards include the Motor Vehicle Emission and Fuel Standards promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Light-Duty Vehicle GHG Emissions Standards promulgated by EPA, and the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The order also included a nonbinding electrification goal that “50 percent of all new passenger cars and light trucks sold in 2030 be zero-emissions vehicles, including battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, or fuel cell electric vehicles.” EPA published its final rule—“Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles”—on April 18, 2024 (89 FR 27842). NHTSA announced its final rule—the “Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards for Passenger Cars and Light Trucks for Model Years 2027 and Beyond and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and Vans for Model Years 2030 and Beyond”—on June 7, 2024 (pre-publication).Emissions from AutomobilesThe light-duty vehicle (LDV) and medium-duty vehicle (MDV) sectors (defined at 40 C.F.R. §86 and 49 C.F.R. §523) generally include passenger cars, light trucks, and most sport utility vehicles; as well as class 2b and class 3 trucks such as large pickups and vans. EPA reports that these vehicles contribute to air pollution, such as “ozone, particulate matter, and air toxics, which are linked with premature death and other serious health impacts, including respiratory illness, cardiovascular problems, and cancer.” The agency estimates that LDVs and MDVs currently account for approximately 11% of the United States’ annual anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), 8% of volatile organic compounds (VOC), and 1% of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Further, according to EPA’s Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2022 (published April 2024), LDVs emitted over 1 billion metric tons of GHGs in 2022, or about 16% of the United States’ annual anthropogenic emissions of GHGs.Agency AuthoritiesEPA’s Air Pollution StandardsSection 202 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 (CAA; P.L. 91-604, as amended) requires EPA to establish standards for emissions of air pollutants from new motor vehicles which, in the Administrator’s judgment, cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare (42 U.S.C. §7521). Standards under Section 202 must also consider issues such as technological feasibility, the cost of compliance, and industry lead time, among other items. EPA has since promulgated standards for emissions of nonmethane organic gases (NMOG), NOx, PM, carbon monoxide (CO), and formaldehyde (an air toxic).EPA’s GHG StandardsIn the 2007 decision Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court held that EPA has the authority to regulate GHGs from new motor vehicles as “air pollutants” under CAA Section 202. In the 5-4 decision, the Court’s majority concluded that EPA must decide whether GHG emissions from new motor vehicles contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare or provide a reasonable explanation why it cannot or will not make that decision. In December 2009, EPA promulgated findings that GHGs endanger both public health and welfare and that GHG emissions from new motor vehicles contribute to that endangerment (74 FR 66495). With these findings, the CAA required EPA to establish standards.NHTSA’s CAFE StandardsThe Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA; P.L. 94-163) established CAFE standards for passenger cars beginning in model year (MY) 1978 and for light trucks beginning in MY1979 (49 U.S.C. Chapter 329). The standards are designed primarily to conserve petroleum. They require each auto manufacturer to meet a target for the sales-weighted fuel economy of its entire fleet of vehicles sold in the United States in each model year. Under EPCA, CAFE standards and new vehicle fuel economy rose steadily through the late 1970s and early 1980s. After 1985, Congress did not revise the legislated standard for passenger cars for several decades, and it remained at 27.5 miles per gallon (mpg) until 2011. The light truck standard was increased to 20.7 mpg in 1996, where it remained until 2005. In 2007, Congress enacted the Energy Independence and Security Act (P.L. 110-140), mandating a phase-in of higher CAFE standards reaching 35 mpg by 2020. This was the last legislation on CAFE passed by Congress.Prior StandardsAir Pollution StandardsEPA’s prior air pollution standards for LDVs (Tier 3, 79 FR 23414) were finalized in March 2014, to be phased-in between 2017 and 2025, and closely align with California’s Low-Emission Vehicle (LEV) III program. Manufacturers must meet fleet-average tailpipe emissions standards for NMOG + NOx, PM, CO, and formaldehyde in a given model year across several different test cycles. Tier 3 also includes standards for low-sulfur fuel, evaporative emissions, and on-board diagnostics, as well as compliance flexibilities such as an emissions averaging, banking, and trading program.CAFE and GHG Standards: Rulemakings  EPA’s prior set of GHG emissions standards (86 FR 74434), promulgated in December 2021, extends through MY2026, culminating in a projected industry fleet-wide GHG compliance target of 161 grams/mile (g/mi). NHTSA’s prior set of fuel economy standards (87 FR 25710) also extends through MY2026, culminating in a projected industry fleet-wide fuel economy target of 49 mpg.CAFE and GHG Standards: Attributes  The agencies’ fuel economy and GHG standards apply to the new fleet of passenger cars and light trucks sold by a manufacturer within the United States during a given model year. Starting with the standards finalized in 2010, the agencies have used the concept of a vehicle’s “footprint” (i.e., the measured area enclosed by the four tires) to set differing targets for different-sized vehicles, all of which increase in stringency year after year. Generally, the larger the vehicle footprint, the lower the corresponding fuel economy target and the higher the CO2-equivalent emissions target. This concept differs from the original CAFE standards, which grouped domestic passenger cars, imported passenger cars, and light trucks into three broad categories. The newer, “attribute-based standards” enable manufacturers to produce a range of vehicle sizes rather than designing a lighter and smaller vehicle fleet overall to meet categorical targets.Manufacturers must report vehicle characteristics sold each model year. These data allow EPA and NHTSA to calculate each manufacturer’s CAFE and GHG targets under the standards given the specific pattern of sales. The agencies then compare the calculated targets against the vehicles’ fuel economy and emissions results from EPA-approved test cycles to determine compliance. To facilitate compliance, the agencies provide manufacturers various flexibilities. A manufacturer’s fleet-wide performance (as measured on the test cycles) can be adjusted through the use of alternative fuel vehicles, air conditioning efficiency improvements, and “off-cycle” technologies (e.g., active aerodynamics, thermal controls, and idle reduction). Further, manufacturers can generate credits for over-compliance with the standards in a given year. They can bank, borrow, and transfer these credits within their own fleets or trade them with other manufacturers to achieve compliance.NHTSA’s 2024 Final RuleNHTSA’s 2024 final rule includes new fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks, which would increase, on average, at a rate of 2% per year during MYs 2027–2031 for passenger cars, and 2% per year during MYs 2029–2031 for light trucks. The agency projects that the proposed standards would require an industry fleet-wide average for passenger cars and light trucks of roughly 50.4 mpg in MY2031. NHTSA projects that the proposed standards would reduce U.S. gasoline consumption by a total of 70 billion gallons through 2050 and would reduce average fuel outlays by over $600 per vehicle over the lifetimes of the LDVs under compliance. EPA’s 2024 Final RuleAir Pollution Standards. EPA’s 2024 final rule for LDVs (Tier 4) includes NMOG + NOx standards that phase-down to a fleet average of 15 milligrams (mg)/mi by MY2032, representing a 50% reduction from the Tier 3 standards. The MDV standards would see a 58% and 70% reduction compared to Tier 3, for class 2b and 3 vehicles, respectively. EPA also finalized a PM standard of 0.5 mg/mi for both LDVs and MDVs. GHG Standards. EPA’s 2024 final rule for LDV GHG standards increases in stringency each year from MY2027 to MY2032. The agency projects the standards would result in an industry-wide average target of 85 g/mi of CO2 in MY2032, representing about a 50% reduction relative to the MY2026 standards. Additional components of the standards include, among other items, narrowing the difference in stringency between passenger cars and light trucks, phasing out the off-cycle credit programs, and rescinding regulations that would consider upstream power sector emissions tied to electric vehicle use, which were to start in MY2027. The MDV standards are projected to result in an average target of 274 g/mile of CO2 by MY2032, representing a 44% reduction compared to MY2026.EPA states the final standards are projected “to accelerate the transition to clean vehicle technologies,” estimating that from MYs 2030-2032, manufacturers may choose to produce battery electric vehicles for about 30% to 56% of new LDV sales and about 20% to 32% of new MDV sales. Manufacturers also are expected to use other vehicle technologies, including hybrid electric and less emitting internal combustion engines.EPA estimates that the total benefits of the 2024 final rule exceed the total costs, with the annualized value of monetized net benefits to society estimated to be $99 billion through the year 2055. This includes $46 billion in reduced annual fuel costs, and nearly $16 billion in reduced annual maintenance and repair costs for drivers. Further, EPA projects cumulative CO2 reductions of approximately 7.2 billion metric tons and cumulative air pollution reductions of 8,700 U.S. tons of PM, 36,000 U.S. tons of NOx, and 150,000 U.S. tons of NMOG, providing $13 billion in annual health benefits through 2055. In addition, EPA estimates consumers will save an average of $6,000 over the lifetime of a new vehicle from reduced fuel and maintenance costs, once the standards are fully phased in.EPA contends that its rule builds upon announcements by automakers that collectively signal a rapidly growing shift away from internal combustion engine technologies and toward zero-emission technologies, including electrification. For support, the agency points to actions taken by Congress, such as P.L. 117-58 (the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act) and P.L. 117-169 (commonly referred to as the Inflation Reduction Act), which provide investment to accelerate the development of and market for zero-emission technology. Others, including some Members of Congress, have expressed concerns over the rule’s implicit mandate for vehicle electrification, increased industry costs, reduced consumer choice, and dependence on foreign markets for critical minerals.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IF/PDF/IF12433/IF12433.4.pdf
IF12636,2024-05-15T04:00:00Z,2025-06-21T03:38:52Z,Nuclear Energy in a Climate Change Context: Current Appropriations for Nuclear Energy Development,"The potential role of nuclear energy in mitigating climate change has been a significant element of recent congressional discussions about energy and environmental policy. For example, Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Tom Carper at a committee hearing in April 2023 stated, “As many of you know, I believe that safe nuclear power plays an essential role in our efforts to address the greatest challenge of our time, the climate crisis.” Other Members of Congress have expressed opposition to nuclear power over concerns that include safety, cost, and the risk of storage of spent nuclear fuel. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (P.L. 118-42) includes more than $5 billion in new funding and transfers for advanced reactors and fuel, as well as support for existing civilian nuclear power. Nuclear energy is also included as a consideration in the Biden Administration’s Long-Term Strategy for the United States on climate change.U.S. Climate StrategyHuman-caused emissions increase the levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, causing global average temperature increases, with a corresponding increase in the net negative effects of climate change. Average global temperatures have increased by approximately 1.0( C since the preindustrial period, with corresponding identified climate-driven impacts. A scientific consensus exists that reducing net global GHG emissions to zero (net zero) by 2050 is consistent with a greater than 50% chance of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5( C. The Long-Term Strategy includes a goal of reducing U.S. GHG emissions to net zero by 2050, as a contribution to limiting climate-driven impacts. As a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the United States submitted a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) document with the goal of reducing U.S. GHG emissions by 50%-52% by 2030 compared with 2005. All pathways described in the Long-Term Strategy that achieve net-zero U.S. GHG emissions by 2050 incorporate achieving the 2030 U.S. NDC GHG emissions reduction goal. Many factors contribute to the U.S. emission of GHGs. The pace of U.S. GHG emissions reduction has not occurred, and is not currently projected to occur, at a rate that some experts assess is in line with meeting these stated climate goals. Emissions reductions in industrial processes, transportation, and other sectors have proven challenging. Replacement of certain fossil fuels with low-carbon electrification and alternative energy sources has been seen as a mechanism for GHG emissions reduction.Rising U.S. electricity demand could pose additional challenges. Some stakeholders in the electricity sector have raised concerns that increases in electricity demand, including those of data centers, and the effects of a transition to lower carbon electricity generation could affect electric grid reliability. Potential Role of Nuclear PowerSupporters of nuclear energy contend that nuclear energy could contribute to bringing the United States onto a decarbonization trajectory consistent with its 2050 net-zero GHG emissions goal. Proponents say this could be accomplished, for example, by increasing nuclear-generated electricity and using nuclear reactor heat for industrial processes, such as the production of hydrogen, replacing equivalent energy from fossil fuels. Increasing the role of nuclear power would likely involve building new nuclear generating capacity both to replace existing, aging nuclear reactors and to create a net increase in nuclear generating capacity. Some nuclear power advocates state that such efforts would be facilitated byusing standardized reactor designs, such as small modular reactors (SMRs), that could be built in series to achieve construction economies of scale; increasing the capability and capacity of the nuclear workforce and supply chains;developing advanced reactors that could be smaller, safer, and less expensive than existing nuclear technology; andusing nuclear fuel developed for enhanced safety and requiring less frequent reactor refueling.Some environmental advocates have questioned the use of nuclear energy to contribute to mitigating climate change. Such groups raise concerns about nuclear energy that include cost, timing, safety, whether nuclear power’s life-cycle carbon emissions are as low as those from renewable energy technologies, and nuclear weapons proliferation.The construction of nuclear power plants often has been subject to large cost overruns and schedule delays, sometimes leading to the abandonment of a project. Recently completed (and proposed) U.S. nuclear projects have relied at least partly on tax credits, government grants, and other assistance to be economically viable. Concerns have been raised about the cost-effective construction of nuclear energy projects and whether financing other efforts to reduce GHG emissions might be more effective. Proponents of funding for nuclear energy point to the operating characteristics of nuclear power plants that can contribute to electric reliability, including their ability to operate constantly and support voltage and frequency levels on the grid. Some lower cost non-emitting resources, such as wind and solar electricity generation, do not inherently operate this way, potentially limiting their ability to supply large shares of electricity generation without the use of additional technologies such as large-scale energy storage.The time required to site, build, permit, test, and operationalize nuclear plants—more than 14 years by one environmental group’s estimate—may be too long for nuclear power to make a meaningful contribution to climate change mitigation. Proposed changes, such as standardized designs, aim to shorten these timelines.In the wake of incidents at nuclear power plants at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, some environmental groups have raised concerns about the safety of nuclear energy and its expansion. Concerns have also been raised about the safety of the long-term storage of the spent nuclear fuel produced by nuclear reactors. Life-cycle analysis has been used to compare GHG emissions from nuclear energy production with emissions from renewable energy sources. The life-cycle emissions from nuclear energy production include mining, milling, and transporting nuclear fuel, as well as the emissions associated with waste management and the construction of nuclear facilities. A National Renewable Energy Laboratory study found that life-cycle GHG estimates for nuclear power were similar to those for most renewable energy sources and a fraction of those for fossil fuels. Nuclear Energy Current AppropriationsThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is the primary agency that carries out federal civilian nuclear energy programs (see Table 1). Major nuclear energy programs include advanced reactor research, development, and demonstration; nuclear production of hydrogen; advanced nuclear fuel availability; and research on the operation and safety of existing reactors.Funding for those activities is included in DOE’s Nuclear Energy appropriations account, which received $1.685 billion in the FY2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which also included a major transfer of previously appropriated nuclear funding as described below. The nuclear energy account increased by $212 million (14%) over the FY2023 amount.Congress has provided additional funding for DOE nuclear energy activities through supplemental appropriations bills and advance appropriations in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA; P.L. 117-58). Through IIJA, Congress appropriated $2.477 billion for the DOE Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program from FY2022 to FY2026. Under that program, DOE is paying up to 50% of the costs of two advanced reactor demonstrations, one each in Wyoming and Texas. In addition, through IIJA, Congress appropriated $6 billion over the same period for Civil Nuclear Credits to support existing nuclear power plants at risk of closing for financial reasons. Most of the Civil Nuclear Credit funding was not used for that purpose due to a number of factors, including rising wholesale electricity prices, state support, and federal tax credits provided to nuclear plants in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA; P.L. 117-169).

R48480,2025-07-01T04:00:00Z,2025-07-02T17:05:42Z,Nuclear Energy and Climate Change Mitigation,"Congress has long been interested in nuclear energy policy in the context of climate change mitigation. A scientific consensus holds that human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions raise global average temperatures. Nuclear energy is among the technologies that could help reduce GHG emissions by providing a low-carbon source of electricity generation to meet existing and future electricity demand. Although U.S. electricity demand has remained generally flat over the last 15 years, it is projected to increase significantly due to the growth of data centers, new domestic manufacturing, and ongoing electrification of the economy. Mitigating climate change may include reducing GHG emissions from electricity generation and converting energy consumption sectors—transportation, industry, and buildings—to utilize electricity with lower GHG emissions. As a source of low-carbon energy, nuclear power is often weighed against the cost, benefits, and risks of other options to mitigate GHG emissions. These include low-carbon options such as wind, solar, and other renewables, and measures to improve energy efficiency. Low-emissions power generation that obtains energy from intermittently available sources such as solar radiation and wind has lower dispatchability than thermal power plants. Among other sources of electricity generation, nuclear and hydropower are the primary zero-emissions (at the power plant) technologies that can provide 24-hour, dispatchable electricity, and nuclear energy can also provide nearly continuous generation to serve “baseload” demand. Nuclear energy could also reduce GHG emissions from industrial processes (e.g., by producing low-carbon hydrogen as a fuel or feedstock). According to a 2021 National Renewable Energy Laboratory study, GHG emissions from the nuclear life cycle are significantly lower than for fossil fuels and comparable to those from low-carbon renewables (e.g., wind).U.S. nuclear power generation has been largely flat for the past 25 years, as natural gas and renewable energy have captured most of the market for new capacity. Options for increasing nuclear energy capacity include expanding existing operational plants, restarting closed plants, building new conventional nuclear plants, and building new small modular reactors and other advanced design plants. Recent U.S. interest in new plants has focused on advanced reactors that could have different coolants, fuels, and other characteristics from conventional reactors.The time required for planning, design, licensing, and construction of nuclear plants has varied widely in the past. In the United States, the most intense period of nuclear reactor startups was from 1973 to 1987, when 87 reactors began operating. Worldwide construction times for reactors that started operating since 1980 have varied widely. Global data indicate that reactors that began operation in 2023 took an average of 10 years to construct. Construction costs have varied widely around the world. Nuclear power plant construction often has been subject to large cost overruns and schedule delays, sometimes leading to the abandonment of a project. The potential contribution of nuclear energy to climate change mitigation is strongly dependent on the speed of deployment. Factors affecting the speed of nuclear deployment—including cost, licensing, and construction time—may affect the contribution to climate change mitigation.Although nuclear energy could support climate mitigation, nuclear energy also entails specific risks not associated with other forms of energy production, including weapons proliferation, safety with respect to radiological release, and other nuclear-specific incidents. The potential benefits of using nuclear energy for emissions mitigation can be assessed against these risks. Proliferation concerns focus especially on nuclear fuel cycle facilities, because some of these facilities can also be used to produce fissile material for nuclear warheads. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 requires NRC to ensure that licensed nuclear facilities “provide adequate protection to the health and safety of the public.” But nuclear incidents in the United States and other countries have underscored potential safety risks of nuclear power. Developing central storage and disposal sites for highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants has also proven difficult in the United States and globally.The Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy Act of 2024 (ADVANCE Act; Division B of P.L. 118-67) contains multiple provisions for streamlining the nuclear power plant licensing process and the efficiency of NRC. Some Members of Congress have expressed strong interest in NRC’s implementation of the ADVANCE Act, and oversight may continue in the 119th Congress. If Congress chooses to promote further nuclear energy expansion, broad approaches could include speeding up the process of bringing new nuclear energy capacity online, providing direct financial support for nuclear capacity, and providing indirect support, such as funding for advanced reactor fuel supply and research and development. Risks related to nuclear power are continuing topics of congressional concern. Bills on these issues, such as the Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act (H.R. 466, S. 101), have been introduced in the 119th Congress.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R48480/R48480.3.pdf
IF12753,2024-09-04T04:00:00Z,2025-06-21T04:20:22Z,Climate Change: What Are Net-Zero Emissions?,"“Net-zero emissions” refers to a situation in which human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from sources such as fossil fuel combustion and deforestation are fully balanced by carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere. Methods of removal include natural absorption and storage in forests and other ecosystems as well as technological removal and storage. When emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are balanced by and equal to the removal of CO2, the net addition of CO2 to the atmosphere is equal to zero. This balance is referred to as net-zero CO2. CO2 is not the only GHG. Human-caused emissions of other GHGs—including methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)—also increase global temperatures. The influence of GHGs on global temperatures is the combined effect of CO2 and the other non-CO2 GHGs. The combined influence of all GHGs may be determined by normalizing the global warming potentials of the GHGs to the global warming potential of carbon dioxide (CO2). This results in a metric of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) to compare across GHGs.Net-zero GHG means that the combined net emissions of all GHGs must be zero, accounting for the different warming effects of the various GHGs. For example, methane is a 27-30 times stronger GHG than CO2, over a 100-year time horizon. No commercially available method for removing non-CO2 GHGs from the atmosphere exists. This means that to balance emissions of non-CO2 GHGs that cannot be abated, additional removals of CO2, by the use of CDR, would be needed. These removals are sometimes known as negative emissions. Net-zero GHG is achieved when CO2e emissions of all GHGs are equal to CO2e removals from the atmosphere through removals of CO2.Application of the Net-Zero ConceptThe concept of net-zero emissions has found application in international and domestic climate change policy. Human-caused CO2 emissions increase the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. Higher levels of CO2 result in increases in global average temperature and a corresponding increase in global net negative effects. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has estimated that human activity since the Industrial Revolution has resulted in 1.07oC of warming compared with a preindustrial baseline temperature. The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) stated, “With every additional degree of warming, the United States is expected to see increasingly adverse consequences.” There is broad scientific consensus that if society does not halt the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere, global warming will continue and the risk of more severe climate impacts will increase. Temperature Stabilization and Net-ZeroGlobal temperatures are generally not expected to stabilize until after GHG emissions are at net-zero. The sooner net-zero is attained, the smaller the temperature rise and climate impacts are likely to be.Climate goals for global temperature stabilization have been set by international agreement under the Paris Agreement (PA). The PA is the second major subsidiary to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which the United States ratified. The temperature aims of the PA are stated as[h]olding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.Climate scientists use climate models to project the behavior of the earth’s climate under a range of potential human-driven emissions scenarios. Using climate models, researchers have estimated when net-zero GHG would need to be reached to achieve these PA climate goals. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report and the USGCRP Fifth National Climate Assessment state that achieving net-zero CO2 by 2050 and net-zero GHG later in the 21st century are consistent with limiting the increase in global temperatures to 1.5oC above the pre-industrial level. As models, methods, and emissions scenarios vary, there is a degree of uncertainty in these estimates.Carbon Dioxide Removal and Hard-to-Abate EmissionsMost climate scientists do not consider the elimination of all human-caused GHG emissions feasible, in part because of the difficulty of fully eliminating emissions from the global economy. For example, in some industries, such as steel and cement, CO2 emissions are particularly challenging to abate because they are generated during the chemical reactions of production. Some scenarios of the IPCC and the USGCRP combine projected large reductions in emissions with human-mediated, long-term carbon dioxide removal. CDR methods include enhanced CO2 removal on land by forests, crops, and soils; ocean-based removal in coastal areas (i.e., blue carbon) and the open ocean (e.g., iron fertilization); and mechanical removal by direct air capture. In the scenarios described above, GHG emissions are reduced to levels that can be balanced by human-mediated CDR, such that the net addition of GHGs to the atmosphere is zero. The scenarios in these reports estimate that net-zero GHG could be reached if human-mediated CDR is used to remove process emissions from industrial sectors that are too difficult, too expensive, or not currently possible to eliminate.Net-Zero in Federal PolicyThe net-zero concept appears in both enacted legislation and executive branch actions. Provisions in recent legislation funded emissions reductions activities, in some cases citing achieving net-zero GHG emissions in specific contexts. Executive orders from the Biden Administration have established a climate policy goal of reaching net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 through both emissions reductions and CDR. While many federal activities support emissions reductions and CDR, this document focuses on those in which net-zero is the stated policy.The Inflation Reduction Act In 2022, Congress passed P.L. 117-169, commonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which has two provisions using net-zero criteria:Section 50161. Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program. This section appropriates approximately $5.8 billion in financial assistance to industrial or manufacturing facilities to help them adopt “advanced industrial technology at an eligible facility.” One of the criteria for receiving the assistance is the level of emissions reductions from an industrial or manufacturing facility. Industrial technologies that accelerate progress to net-zero through GHG emissions reductions are supported. The industries eligible for assistance include the steel, cement, and chemical industries, as well as other energy-intensive processes. Section 70006. FEMA Building Materials Program. This section authorizes the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide financial incentives for “net-zero energy projects.” A January 2024 FEMA memorandum describes the implementation of IRA Section 70006. Financial assistance must be tied to disaster recovery or mitigation, and applicants are encouraged to include net-zero aspects in such projects. Net-zero energy projects are to be funded on the same cost-share basis as other FEMA projects. Funding is available for projects with buildings that meet the energy performance and renewable generation standards of the International Energy Conservation Code for new construction and the International Green Construction Code for existing buildings. The combination of energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy in these standards is considered compliant with the FEMA specifications for a net-zero energy project.Executive ActionsExecutive actions on climate of the Biden Administration, including the Long-Term Strategy of the United States: Pathways to Net-Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 2050 and some executive orders, have included net-zero GHG as a policy component. A key aspiration of the Biden Administration Long-Term Strategy is to achieve a 50%-52% GHG emission reduction by 2030 (compared with 2005 levels) and net-zero GHG by 2050. These goals are consistent with the PA to reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. The Long-Term Strategy includes scenarios that achieve these goals through a combination of emissions reductions and CDR. CO2 removal by CDR methods accounts for between 10% and 20% of total net-zero GHG emissions reduction. Several recent analyses from groups in the private sector, academia, and the federal government estimated U.S. net GHG emissions reductions projected through 2030 and found that these estimated emissions reductions would likely not reach the 50%-52% reduction goal. President Biden has issued two executive orders that include net-zero provisions, listed below:Executive Order 14082 of September 12, 2022, Implementation of the Energy and Infrastructure Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The order’s stated purpose is to “effectively implement” the IRA. This executive order directs certain federal agencies to, among other things, prioritize a set of climate goals for the United States. These climate goals set out in Section 2 of the order include reducing GHG emissions 50%–52% below 2005 levels by 2030, achieving a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035, and achieving net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. Executive Order 14057 of December 8, 2021, Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability. This executive order states a policy for the federal government of leading by example to achieve economy-wide net-zero emissions by 2050, through the use of its scale and procurement power. The order directs the federal government to achieve a portfolio of net-zero energy buildings by 2045 and to achieve net-zero emissions in federal procurement, including the use of construction materials with lower embodied emissions, without specifying a target date.Considerations for CongressThe 117th Congress passed legislation with emissions reductions and CDR provisions, including the IRA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58). This legislation provided supplemental appropriations and tax incentives that support emissions reductions and CDR, components of achieving net-zero emissions. Recent analyses have estimated U.S. emissions reductions and CDR and found that the United States may not be on track to reach 50%-52% emissions reduction by 2030. These estimates may play a role in whether Members of Congress consider enhanced oversight of federal climate policy and whether to take additional legislative action with respect to the climate goals.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IF/PDF/IF12753/IF12753.2.pdf
IN11696,2024-05-28T04:00:00Z,2025-06-21T03:41:55Z,"Climate Change, Slow-Onset Disasters, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency","FEMA and Climate ChangeThe United States is already experiencing certain effects of climate change, including high temperature extremes and heavy precipitation events. The U.S. Global Change Research Program, among other bodies, expects these trends to continue and intensify, likely resulting in more severe and frequent “slow-onset” events (e.g., drought; sea level rise), compound disasters (e.g., extreme rainfall combined with coastal flooding), and cascading events (e.g., mudslides caused by flooding after wildfires). Such events may not have clearly defined start or end dates, and cumulative damage may not be immediately apparent. Congress may consider the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA’s) role in addressing these incidents. FEMA administers federal disaster relief authorized under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act, P.L. 93-288, as amended). Although FEMA does not have an explicit mission to address climate change, the agency is increasing its activities related to nationwide adaptation to some of its effects, including extreme weather events. This Insight highlights issues FEMA may face when activating the Stafford Act for slow-onset events endemic to a changing climate. Slow-onset disasters are not mentioned or defined in the Stafford Act, FEMA’s regulations, or guidance, nor are they included in existing emergency or major disaster definitions. Stafford Act DeclarationsThe Stafford Act authorizes the President to declare an incident an emergency or a major disaster. A Stafford Act declaration serves as a means to provide federal assistance to states, territories, and tribes for incident response, recovery, and mitigation. FEMA may authorize several forms of assistance pursuant to a Stafford Act declaration, including Individual Assistance (IA), Public Assistance (PA), and Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA).Under the Stafford Act, governors or tribal chief executives may request an emergency or major disaster declaration when an incident is “of such severity and magnitude” that state, local, tribal, or territorial governments (SLTTs) are unable to effectively respond without federal assistance. The Stafford Act defines a major disaster by listing incidents or situations that exemplify major disasters: /Stafford Act declarations generally respond to rapid-onset events that cause a measurable amount of damage in a particular geographic area over a defined period of time. FEMA refers to the time interval during which the event occurs as the incident period. Per FEMA regulations, Stafford Act assistance shall only alleviate “the damage or hardship ... which took place during the incident period or was in anticipation of that incident.” The Stafford Act and Slow-Onset EventsCurrent authorities limit FEMA’s ability to provide assistance for slow-onset events like on-going inland high water levels, “sunny-day” flooding, sea level rise, erosion, and drought. Damages accrued during slow-onset events may not be easily attributed to a discrete incident or limited to a specific incident period. Further, an individual event in a series (e.g., a single flood as part of recurring flooding), may not, on its own, appear to overwhelm a state or locality, or meet damage thresholds to receive certain forms of Stafford Act assistance. However, some may argue that these incidents—taken together—warrant federal assistance that the Stafford Act is not currently designed to provide. FEMA’s process for assessing losses may limit the availability of assistance for slow-onset events. The factors FEMA uses to evaluate whether to recommend the President authorize PA and/or IA for a major disaster (Figure 1) only consider the effects of the disaster-causing incident during the incident period. Further, some of these factors (e.g., insurance coverage or severe local impacts) may defy measurement for ongoing incidents, and damages may not be easily attributable to a single event (e.g., when an area prone to regular sunny-day flooding is hit by a hurricane).Regulations also require declaration requests be submitted according to deadlines, but a governor or tribal chief executive may struggle to identify the appropriate time to request a Stafford Act declaration for a slow-onset incident. The President generally declares an emergency or major disaster for a discrete event. However, there are examples of multiple, related hazards being included in a single declaration (e.g., a single declaration for noncontiguous wildfires and flooding and mudslides). As the President has discretion to make such a declaration, and as damages caused by slow-onset, compound, or cascading incidents may not be easily attributable to a single event, incidents involving one or multiple, related hazards may receive inconsistent treatment.Considerations for CongressCatastrophic events pose a financial threat to society as a whole and to the federal government, as it allocates increasing resources to disaster relief. The Congressional Budget Office projects hazard-related losses, including those attributed to slow-onset events, will likely increase in the U.S., especially as hazard-prone areas undergo rapid development and observe rising property values. Experts anticipate that resulting damages will mount, straining federal, state, and local governments, as well as businesses and individuals—particularly the socially vulnerable. Given these issues, Congress could consider amending the Stafford Act to support disaster response, recovery, and mitigation associated with slow-onset, compound, or cascading disasters, such asspecifying FEMA’s roles and authorities in the federal response to climate change; amending the major disaster declaration definition to include slow-onset disasters; establishing a new type of declaration and corresponding disaster assistance authorities for slow-onset and ongoing incidents;requiring FEMA to develop a means to assess damage that is not limited to a discrete incident or incident period;requiring FEMA to modify or extend the incident period under certain conditions;continuing to increase funding for pre-disaster mitigation to reduce risk before disasters occur; providing enhanced assistance for vulnerable communities already experiencing the effects of climate change; for example, reducing nonfederal cost shares, altering benefit-cost methodology, expediting and simplifying delivery of assistance, and providing technical assistance to bolster local capacity; andadding to FEMA’s authority to restrict rebuilding assistance in disaster-prone communities, provide pre-disaster mitigation assistance to reduce future losses to extreme weather events projected under future conditions, and/or shift spending from response and recovery to mitigation.Figure 1.Major Disaster Assistance Evaluation and Approval/Sources: CRS interpretation of 44 C.F.R. §206.48 and FEMA, Tribal Declarations Pilot Guidance, January 2017.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IN/PDF/IN11696/IN11696.5.pdf
R46766,2022-02-17T05:00:00Z,2025-06-20T23:22:17Z,Climate Change Risk Disclosures and the Securities and Exchange Commission,"Potential risks to the U.S. financial system from climate change have attracted growing attention in government, academia, and media, raising questions about the roles of financial regulators in addressing such risks. Scientific assessments have concluded that human activities—and particularly carbon dioxide and methane emitted by fossil fuels, agriculture, and land use change—are extremely [>95% likelihood] likely the primary driver of the rise of global average temperature since 1950. Climate change—defined by the Federal Reserve as “the trend toward higher average global temperatures and accompanying environmental shifts such as rising sea levels and more severe weather events”—may impact multiple financial regulators’ responsibilities, including those of ensuring financial stability. Risks from climate change may belong to the category of physical risks, such as heavier and more frequent storms or wildfires that impose direct losses. Or they may consist of transition risk, meaning the risk that changing government policies or market perceptions might lead to sudden asset price drops, such as for carbon-emitting industries. A 2020 report by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) found that climate change could pose systemic risks to the U.S. financial system.The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) mission is to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation. As part of this mission, the SEC issued “Guidance Regarding Disclosure Related to Climate Change” in 2010 to assist publicly listed companies in evaluating when climate change risks require disclosure. However, the 2020 CFTC report concluded that the 2010 SEC guidance has not resulted in high-quality disclosure of climate change risks across U.S. publicly listed firms, and that it should be updated in light of global advancements over the preceding 10 years. In July 2021, SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced that he had instructed SEC staff to develop a mandatory climate risk disclosure rule proposal for the commission’s consideration, citing a high level of investor demand. The amount of money involved in adequate disclosure of risks from climate change for equity investors is potentially large. The total market capitalization of the U.S. stock market at the end of 2020 was about $50.8 trillion. Some studies have estimated the dollar risks from undisclosed climate-related risks to also be large. Two central questions are whether, and to what degree, emergent climate change risks are of material importance to investors, and to what degree current disclosures of climate change risks have been useful to investors. A 2018 GAO report examined the steps taken by the SEC to aid companies’ understanding of the disclosure regime for climate-related risks. GAO observed that some filings had climate-related disclosures that used boilerplate language that was not company-specific and thus lacked quantification.The SEC also appears to be reexamining disclosures by “Environmental, Social and Governance” (ESG) funds. Though there is no legally binding definition of what constitutes an ESG fund, the term refers to portfolios of equities and/or bonds—typically mutual funds—for which environmental, social, and governance factors are integrated into the investment process. The SEC’s Division of Investment Management has primary responsibility for administering the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. §§ 80-1 et seq.) and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-1 et seq.) which includes developing regulatory policy for investment companies (such as mutual funds) and for investment advisers. The SEC does not have rules that specifically govern the use of ESG principles or their disclosures relevant to climate change. In recent years, funds marketed to investors as “ESG” have grown markedly in terms of assets under management. More recently, the SEC announced creation of an ESG Task Force to analyze disclosure and compliance issues relating to ESG strategies. In April 2020, the SEC’s Division of Examinations warned that its review of ESG funds had found a number of misleading statements regarding ESG investing processes and adherence to global ESG frameworks, among other issues. In July 2021, SEC Chair Gensler noted the absence of a “standardized meaning” of such so-called ESG, green, or sustainable funds. He then indicated that he had requested that the SEC staff consider recommendations on whether managers of such sustainable funds need to disclose the criteria and underlying data they employ. On September 22, 2021, the SEC’s Division of Corporate Finance, referencing the 2010 climate change guidance, issued sample letters for public companies to guide them in their climate-related corporate disclosures. The sample letter directed companies to consider in their disclosures the impact of pending or existing climate-change-related legislation, regulations, and international accords; the indirect consequences of regulation or business trends; and the physical impacts of climate change on their businesses.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R46766/R46766.4.pdf
IN12250,2023-09-25T04:00:00Z,2025-06-21T03:06:52Z,Climate Change and Extreme Heat,"The United States experienced a series of record-breaking heat waves during the summer of 2023. The heat waves brought extreme temperatures to various U.S. regions, including Puerto Rico, the southern Plains, and the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, with life threatening conditions in some areas. These heat waves are part of a trend of rising global temperatures. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) maintain datasets of global average surface temperatures. According to these datasets, as of January 2023, the warmest years since the advent of modern recordkeeping occurred in 2010-2022, with 2016 and 2020 tied (i.e., statistically indistinguishable) as the warmest years on record (Figure 1). Figure 1. Global Average Temperature Anomalies 1850-2022/Source: NOAA, National Centers for Environmental information, Climate at a Glance: Global Time Series.Note: Global average temperature anomalies calculated as deviations from the 1901-2000 baseline average. Independently developed global temperatures datasets that differ from the NASA and NOAA datasets in duration and methodology, including analyses using different baseline reference temperatures, show close agreement (Figure 2) with respect to global temperatures and trends. Figure 2. Global Average Temperatures Anomalies: Four Independent Datasets/Source: Alan Buis, “The Raw Truth on Global Temperature Records,” National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), March 25, 2021, https://climate.nasa.gov/explore/ask-nasa-climate/3071/the-raw-truth-on-global-temperature-records/. Note: Global average temperature difference from a baseline reference average value (1951-1980). The Connection Between Human-Influenced Climate Change and Extreme HeatThe observed rising global temperatures are associated with increasingly frequent and intense climate change impacts, including extreme high temperatures and periods of abnormally hot weather known as heat waves. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report states (with associated confidence levels) the following:The frequency and intensity of hot extremes (including heatwaves) have increased, and those of cold extremes have decreased on the global scale since 1950 (virtually certain).Climate change attribution is the study of whether, or to what degree, human influence may have contributed to extreme climate or weather events. Some climate change attribution studies of extreme heat events in the United States from 2011 to 2014 have attributed increases in the frequency or intensity of these extreme heat events to human-influenced climate change. Human-driven emissions of greenhouse gases are likely to be the cause of the increased temperatures that have been associated with these extreme heat events. The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) Fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA4) states, “It is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.” Similarly, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report states that “human-induced greenhouse gas forcing is the main driver of the observed changes in hot and cold extremes on the global scale (virtually certain) and on most continents (very likely).” Climate Change and Estimates of Future Extreme HeatThe NCA4, using scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions and climate policies, states that “statistically significant warming is projected for all parts of the United States throughout the century.” This warming is part of the ongoing, observed global increase in average temperature discussed above. Researchers measure this increase by comparing the current and projected global average temperatures with a historical period before large-scale industrialization, such as 1850-1900 (pre-industrial period). The estimated warming level in June 2023 was 1.2oC (2.2oF), indicating that the global temperature has risen 1.2oC (2.2oF) since the pre-industrial period. The Paris Agreement climate treaty recognizes that limiting warming to 1.5oC (2.7oF) reduces climate change risk and impacts. The IPCC estimates warming may reach the 1.5oC (2.7oF) level between 2030 and 2052.Increases in global average temperature affect the way the climate behaves, including the incidence of heat extremes. While there is no universally agreed on definition of extreme heat, one IPCC metric is the average annual number of days in which temperatures exceed thresholds of 35oC (95oF) and 40oC (104oF), compared with a 1986-2005 baseline period. These temperature thresholds have been associated with adverse impacts on agriculture and human health.In models presented by the IPCC, the average annual number of extreme heat days for geographic regions containing the United States would increase under global warming potentially occurring during the 21st century. Estimates of extreme heat associated with global warming may change with scientific developments. Considerations for CongressThe 117th Congress passed the legislation known as the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which, among other goals, aimed to address extreme heat by reducing climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions. Example activities includedenhancing electricity grid resilience, reducing the impacts on transportation infrastructure, andreducing urban heat islands.Members of the 118th Congress have expressed interest in addressing the health effects of extreme heat and improving the preparation and response to heat waves and other extreme heat events. The Biden Administration has announced activities to address extreme heat, which are subject to congressional oversight. They include the formation of the National Integrated Heat Health Information System, a collaborative effort by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), NOAA, and other federal agencies, as well as activities funded under the Inflation Reduction Act that include grants to increase urban green spaces, loans to upgrade residences to provide protection from extreme heat, and improvements to extreme heat forecasting by NOAA.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IN/PDF/IN12250/IN12250.2.pdf
IF12161,2023-04-06T04:00:00Z,2025-06-21T01:15:35Z,Climate Change and Adaptation: Department of Defense,"Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has stated that “to keep the nation secure, [the Department of Defense (DOD)], must tackle the existential threat of climate change.” DOD has released a number of documents outlining how it plans to adapt to and address climate change, including the 2021 DOD Climate Risk Analysis and the DOD Climate Adaptation Plan. Congress may conduct oversight of the implementation of these plans. Congress could also consider examining possible climate risks and assessing possible implications for global security, military readiness and infrastructure, and DOD force structure when considering authorization, appropriations, and other legislation.Implications of Climate Change for the U.S. MilitaryDOD Directive (DODD) 4715.21, “Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience,” took effect in 2016 and outlines department policy, roles, and responsibilities related to climate change. The directive defines climate change as variations in average weather conditions that persist over multiple decades or longer that encompass increases and decreases in temperature, shifts in precipitation, and changing risk of certain types of severe weather events.DOD’s Climate Risk Analysis report concludes that these variations could produce climate hazards such as sea or glacial ice retreat, rising sea levels, flooding, drought, extreme heat, wildfires, and tropical cyclones. Each of these hazards in turn holds implications for international security. For example, drought could lead to inadequate water supplies and adverse impacts on agricultural production. This could increase competition for, or conflict over, natural resources in affected areas. Flooding could damage critical infrastructure and displace populations, which could in turn cause mass migration or political crises. DOD notes that such hazards could “[reshape] the geostrategic, operational, and tactical environments with significant implications for U.S. national security and defense.” DOD’s Climate Risk Analysis report further notes thatas the frequency and intensity of [climate] hazards increase ... [they may] affect the demands on and functionality of military operations, and increase the number and severity of humanitarian crises, at times threatening stability and security.DOD has sought to increase military readiness and may propose changes in military equipment or force structure in anticipation of increased operations due to climate change. For example, extreme weather events could increase demand for humanitarian assistance and disaster response capabilities, while glacial ice retreat could lead to increased regionial competition in the Arctic, with an increase in demand for specialized, cold-weather military equipment for U.S. forces. According to DOD officials, climate change has growing implications for the costs of operating U.S. military installations and associated equipment. DOD maintains more than 5,000 military installations worldwide. Of these, more than 1,700 are in coastal areas and have been or may be affected by sea-level rise or extreme weather events. In 2018, Hurricane Michael caused an estimated $4.7 billion in damage to Florida’s Tyndall Air Force Base (with more than 12 F-22 fighter aircraft sustaining damage), while Hurricane Florence caused around $3.6 billion in damages to North Carolina’s Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune. In 2021, winter storms damaged 694 facilities across four military installations in Texas (Fort Hood), Oklahoma (Fort Sill), Kansas (Fort Riley), and Louisiana (Fort Polk). Some analysts have argued that rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and other climate-related factors could impact transportation routes, port infrastructure, or manufacturing facilities, which could in turn affect both commercial and military supply chains. DOD Climate Adaptation PlanningDODD 4715.21 defines climate adaptation as an “adjustment in natural or human systems in anticipation of or response to a changing environment in a way that effectively uses beneficial opportunities or reduces negative efforts.” DOD’s Climate Adaptation Plan builds upon previous DOD climate change-related policies to “ensure the DOD can operate under changing climate conditions.” The adaptation plan outlines five lines of effort (LOE): 1. Climate-informed decision-making based on climate assessments;2. Train and equip a climate ready force able to operate in extreme weather conditions;3. Infrastructure to support military operations under changing conditions;4. Supply chain resilience and innovation in austere locations; and5. Enhance adaptation and resilience through collaboration with other federal agencies, Congress, U.S. allies and partners, and other stakeholders.These LOEs and related enablers, such as monitoring and data analytics, constitute DOD’s Climate Adaptation Strategic Framework. DOD’s Climate Adaptation Plan additionally states that all department operations, plans, and procedures must include climate change considerations “to ensure the military forces of the United States retain operational advantage under all conditions.” Similarly, Executive Order 14008, signed in 2021, directs the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to incorporate climate considerations into the National Defense Strategy and other relevant strategy and planning documents.Legislative ActivityCongress has conducted oversight of DOD climate-related activities. In Section 951 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA; P.L. 110-181), Congress required that the first National Security Strategy and first National Defense Strategy prepared after January 2008 include guidance for military planners to assess the risks of projected climate change to current and future mission of the Armed Forces.Section 335 of the FY2018 NDAA (P.L. 115-91) directed DOD to identify and report on 10 installations per service that were most vulnerable to climate change. This report was delivered to Congress in January 2019; however, three members of the House Armed Services Committee concluded that the report did not address Section 335’s specified criteria and formally requested DOD to submit a revised report. The military services subsequently followed up in 2019 with responses to questions for the record, in which the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps each identified their 10 most vulnerable installations and the Navy identified its 16 most vulnerable. Section 2801 of the FY2020 NDAA (P.L. 116-92) required all major military installations to incorporate resilience information into installation plans, including climate-related threats to military installations, assets or infrastructure vulnerable to such threats, and lessons learned from previous extreme weather events.Subtitle C, “National Security Climate Resilience,” of Title III of the FY2022 NDAA (P.L. 117-81) sought to improve DOD’s climate resilience, defined in the subtitle as “the capability to avoid, prepare for, minimize the effect of, adapt to, and recover from, extreme weather, or from anticipated or unanticipated changes in environmental conditions, that do (or have the potential to) adversely affect the national security of the United States or of allies and partners of the United States.” Subtitle C directs DOD to undertake actions “to ensure that the critical infrastructure of Department facilities is hardened, developed, and constructed for quick recovery from natural disasters and the impacts of extreme weather”; requires the department to include extreme weather events in its reports on the health of the national technology and industrial base and account for climate and environmental challenges in future planning and development; and requires each military department to assess climate risks to their installations and other facilities. The President’s FY2024 DOD budget request proposes $5.1 billion in funding for “enhancing combat capability and mitigating climate risk.” This includes $3.7 billion for installation resiliency and adaptation; $1.3 billion for research, development, test, and evaluation; $100 million for operational energy; and $100 million for contingency preparedness.Considerations for CongressInstallation PlansPursuant to DOD’s Climate Adaptation Plan, DOD completed climate exposure assessments on all major U.S. installations—as defined in 10 U.S.C. §2864–in April 2022 and is in the process of finalizing assessments on all major OCONUS (outside the continental United States) installations. Congress may consider the methods and results of these assessments as it evaluates military construction funding requests or possible future base realignment and closure processes.CostsTo reduce future costs associated with repairing installations affected by climate change or extreme weather events, DOD’s FY2024 budget request includes $3.7 billion for installation resiliency measures, which the budget request states are to “[adapt] military facilities to withstand increasingly challenging conditions and [deploy] advanced technologies to strengthen the ability to rapidly recover from disruptions to public infrastructure” from climate-induced extreme weather. In considering this request, Congress could consider whether or not to direct an assessment of the costs of up-front resilience measures versus the potential costs of installation repair. Members could also seek additional information to set priorities for types, locations, and scheduling of future resilience measures. Service StrategiesIn February 2022, the Department of the Army released its Climate Strategy, detailing the service’s plans for adapting to climate change and enhancing resilience across the force. The strategy outlines a number of metrics by which its implementation can be assessed (e.g., “field an all-electric light-duty non-tactical vehicle fleet by 2027”). Likewise, in May 2022, the Department of the Navy released Climate Action 2030, which identifies two performance goals—building climate resilience and reducing climate threat—for the Navy and Marine Corps. The Department of the Air Force released its climate action plan in October 2022. Such strategies are not, however, statutorily required. As it conducts oversight of climate adaptation and resilience efforts, Congress may consider whether or not to require the services to release climate strategies that detail how the respective service plans to implement overall DOD and executive branch requirements. Congress may additionally consider whether or not to identify more specific goals and evaluative metrics for use by the services.

R47063,2022-04-04T04:00:00Z,2025-06-20T23:28:12Z,How Climate Change May Affect the U.S. Economy,"There is general consensus within the scientific community that human activities have increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and that the increased concentrations have contributed to a rise in global average temperatures. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently assessed, “Overall adverse economic impacts attributable to climate change, including slow-onset and extreme weather events, have been increasingly identified.” Two of the main avenues through which climate change can affect GDP in the short and long terms are productivity and investment effects. Productivity is a key determinant in long-term economic growth—as productivity increases, economies can produce more goods and services with the same level of resources, which in turn tends to increase well-being and income. Business investment is also a determinant of long-term growth insofar as it contributes to the domestic capital stock, which is directly related to the economy’s overall productive capacity. Research suggests that climate change could negatively impact productivity and business investment, as rising temperatures and heat waves could result in lower output per worker. Declines in productivity and production could decrease businesses’ incentive to invest, particularly in a scenario in which physical capital is routinely damaged or destroyed due to the effects of extreme weather events to a point where further investment becomes unattractive. Climate change can also bring some benefits (such as fewer extreme cold events) and opportunities (opening of Arctic shipping lanes), although the net effects of climate change on the economy are generally expected to be increasingly adverse and widespread on net. Climate change—notably the projected increase in certain extreme weather events—is also expected to affect the overall economy through its impacts on specific sectors, such as housing, infrastructure, and agriculture. Nearly one-third of the U.S. housing stock could be at high risk of climate-change-induced hazards, and billions of dollars of property are vulnerable to complete destruction or being rendered unusable by flooding risk alone. Transportation infrastructure, which supports the production and movement of goods and services, could be damaged with climate change. While transportation systems are typically designed to withstand certain magnitudes of extreme weather events, an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events would increase the residual risk. Heat waves, heavy precipitation, and other storms can additionally cause delays and disruptions on roads, public transit systems, airports, and the like, adding to the costs of production and interfering with consumption. There are several considerations to take into account when analyzing research on the economic effects of climate change. One is that economic projection is an imprecise science and entails a degree of uncertainty, and uncertainty may increase over long time horizons. This research becomes more complicated when based on climate modeling results, which are often based on scenarios that may or may not be associated with likelihoods of occurrence or reflect future conditions. Additionally, there is no consensus on the best way to model the economic effects of climate change. Several different methodologies and types of modeling are used to estimate the impacts of various climate change scenarios on economic indicators such as GDP and personal income. Differing methods can make it difficult to compare results across studies. Currently, this field of study into the economic effects of climate change is relatively small compared to other types of economic or climate-related research. The relative dearth of studies makes it challenging to reach specific “mainstream” conclusions about economic impacts. Nonetheless, the large majority of existing studies tend to find that climate change impacts to longer-term economic output—either economy-wide or in impacted sectors—is likely to be negative and increasingly so, although the magnitude of these effects is not widely agreed upon.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R47063/R47063.3.pdf
IN12288,2023-12-15T05:00:00Z,2025-06-21T02:35:25Z,Is Climate Change Influencing Wildfires? Climate Change Effects on Wildfires in the United States,"According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), climate change-driven increases in temperature, drought, and atmospheric drying have led to an increase in wildfire risk and wildfire burned area in the western United States. It is the assessment of the U.S. Forest Service (FS) that fire area and fire-caused tree mortality will increase under future climate change conditions. This Insight describes changes in wildfire activity in the United States in recent decades and the potential influence of climate change on wildfires under current and projected climate change conditions.Recent Decades of Wildfire Activity in the United States Wildfire extent and damage have been growing in the United States since 1983, when federal agencies first implemented current wildland fire reporting processes. Wildland fire statistics from the National Interagency Coordination Center indicate that the number of annual wildfires in the United States is variable but has decreased moderately from 1993 to 2022, while the number of acres burned annually, while also variable, has approximately doubled (Figure 1).The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) in the 2017 science volume of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, using a definition of a large fire as greater than 1,000 acres, reported that “The incidence of large forest fires in the western United States and Alaska has increased since the early 1980s (high confidence).” The 2018 volume of the assessment, which covers impacts and risks, states “increasing wildfire is damaging ranches and rangelands as well as property in cities near the wildland–urban interface.”Figure 1. Annual Wildfires and Acres Burned, 1993-2022/Sources: CRS In Focus IF10244, Wildfire Statistics. Data from National Interagency Coordination Center, Wildland Fire Summary and Statistics annual reports. Note: Data reflect wildland fires and acres burned nationwide, including wildland fires on federal and nonfederal lands.Climate Change Influence on WildfireClimate change attribution studies of wildfires seek to quantify and distinguish the influence of human-caused climate change on wildfires from other influences. In the case of wildfires, these other factors may include historic fire suppression that may have increased fuel load, changes in settlement at the wildland urban interface (WUI), and natural climate variability. Several recent climate change attribution studies suggest that human-caused climate change, independent of other factors, has increased the risk and the extent of wildfire. For example, in 2018, the USGCRP cited an attribution analysis that presents evidence that climate change has been increasing conditions favoring wildfires and the extent of wildfires in some areas of the United States. This analysis found that climate change has driven increases in temperature and atmospheric drying. The resulting drying of wildfire fuels across western U.S. forests during the 2000-2015 period contributed to an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential relative to a 1981-2000 baseline period. The authors of the analysis also concluded that during the 1984-2015 period, these climate drivers had approximately doubled the area of forest burned in the western United States. In another example, a 2023 attribution study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science found that climate change had driven increases in temperature and atmospheric drying of wildfire fuels in California. The authors concluded that almost all of the fivefold increase in the area burned by wildfires in California from 1996 to 2021 compared with 1971-1995 could be attributed to human-caused climate change. Some modeling studies of future climate change have projected increases in wildfire effects on forests in the United States. In 2020, the FS used climate models to assess the effects of climate change on U.S. forests. This assessment found that increases in fire area and fire-caused tree mortality were expected under future conditions of climate change in all parts of the conterminous United States. A later FS modeling study was included as part of the research basis of the 2022 Office of Management and Budget white paper on the federal government’s financial risk exposure to climate change. That FS modeling also found that the area burned by wildfires in the United States is projected to increase under conditions of human-caused climate change. The influence of climate change on wildfire is unlikely to be uniform, as the USGCRP found that “[i]ncreases in future forest fire extent, frequency, and intensity depend strongly on local ecosystem properties and will vary greatly across the United States.”Considerations for CongressAccording to the FS 10-year wildfire implementation plan published in 2022, the increase in the size and severity of wildfires has placed “homes, communities, infrastructure, and natural resources at grave and growing risk,” with wide-ranging impacts to local economies and communities, human wellbeing, and the environment. As such, wildfire could affect broad areas of federal activity, including several federal roles related specifically to wildfire. Agencies that manage federal lands are responsible for wildfire management on those lands, including fire suppression, post-fire recovery, and managing the land for wildfire (as it comports with the agency’s mission), including reducing its likelihood and severity. The federal government also may provide assistance for wildfire suppression and preparedness on nonfederal land. Lastly, the federal government may provide a variety of post-fire disaster assistance to individuals, businesses, communities, and other groups. Potential climate change-induced increases in future wildfire frequency and burned area, as well as other factors such as forest and fuels management and development in the WUI, could affect these federal activities in a variety of ways. For example, increases in burned area could increase the number of people and communities affected, potentially increasing demand for federal disaster relief and suppression resources. Some federal spending related to wildfire has increased in recent decades—for example, appropriations for wildfire management increased from 2011 to 2020. Most of this increase was attributable to wildfire suppression spending. Changes in wildfire risk and extent could shape a wide range of congressional debates, from the appropriate level and distribution of wildfire-related federal spending to the management of federal lands to the federal role in disaster response. These changes also could inform debates regarding the federal response to climate change.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IN/PDF/IN12288/IN12288.1.pdf
IF12282,2022-12-14T05:00:00Z,2025-06-21T02:42:37Z,Australia: Climate Change Issues,"On a per capita basis Australians have the world’s 10th largest carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions: according to the World Bank, Australians emitted 15.2 metric tons of CO2 on a per capita basis in 2019. In 2019, Australia was the 16th largest emitter of all CO2 by country, accounting for approximately 1.3% of the global total. Some experts note, however, that Australia’s total CO2 emissions would be closer to 4% of world emissions if Australia’s fossil fuel exports are included. In 2021, Australia was the world’s leading exporter of coal, accounting for 35.7% of the world’s total coal exports, which was worth $43.9 billion. Australia also is estimated to have the third largest reserves of coal in the world, and is one of the world’s largest exporters of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Impact of Climate ChangeObservers note that some impacts from human-induced climate change, such as an increase in the frequency of extreme heat events, are already occurring in Australia, and they expect current changes to continue and intensify in the future. Average annual temperatures for Australia have warmed 1.4 degrees Celsius since 1910. The year 2019 was the hottest and driest year on record in Australia. The number of extreme fire risk days has grown over the past four decades. “Black Summer” bushfires during the 2019-2020 bushfire season killed 33 people (with an additional 455 deaths attributed to bushfire smoke), burned more than 65,000 square miles of land, released an estimated 186 million tons of carbon into the atmosphere, and killed or displaced close to an estimated 3 billion animals. One report indicated that the emissions from these fires were more than Australia emits in a typical year by burning fossil fuels. Another study found that the annual area burned across Australia has been increasing over the past three decades. Eastern Australia experienced four major floods in the 18 months prior to July 2022. When touring flood-damaged communities in New South Wales (NSW) in July 2022, Prime Minister Albanese stated, “The science told us that if we continued to not take action globally on climate change, then these events, extreme weather events, would be more often and more intense. And what we’re seeing, unfortunately, is that play out.” The New South Wales Climate Change Adaption Strategy states, “Climate change has already altered day-today weather patterns (in NSW) and increased extreme weather events ... with the state warming faster than the global average. Since the pre-industrial period, NSW has already warmed by 1.4-1.6°C (CSIRO 2021) which is 1.4 times faster than the global average.... This means that NSW is already experiencing the impacts of climate change.” NSW is home to just under one-third of Australia’s population and accounts for around one-third of the country’s economic output.Figure 1. Change in Net Emissions of Major Economies [Excluding Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) and Agriculture Emissions] /The Great Barrier Reef, an important global carbon sink and key part of Australia’s tourism sector, suffered mass coral bleaching in 2016, 2017, and 2020 due to rising ocean temperatures likely caused by climate change. While Australia has long experienced drought, bushfires, and flooding, projections indicate Australia will likely experience increasing temperatures, as well as more severe floods, coral bleaching, ocean acidification, droughts, and bushfires, as a consequence of climate change. Domestic Climate PoliticsAustralia has struggled to reconcile its economic reliance on fossil fuels with the need to address climate change. Australia’s position on climate change has been transformed as a result of the May 2022 election, which marked a shift to candidates favoring action on climate change. Former Prime Minister Scott Morrison of the right-of-center Liberal-National Coalition famously brought a lump of coal into parliament in 2017 and urged Australia to not be afraid of coal. Morrison’s lack of action to address climate change is seen as a key reason for his electoral defeat by Anthony Albanese of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), which won 77 of 151 seats in the House of Representatives. “Teal” independents and the Green Party, who urge more immediate action on climate change, also made significant gains in the election. Labor campaigned on a pledge to reduce carbon emissions by 43% by 2030 with a goal of net zero by 2050. (The United States has set a target of 50%-52% reductions over 2005 levels in 2030.) The Green Party’s standing in the Senate may further influence climate change legislation. The Greens argue that “Australia needs urgently to phase out fossil fuels for export and domestic use” and achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2035. Labor will likely need the support of the Greens to pass climate legislation in the Senate. The Greens and independents may seek to leverage this to get the ALP to set more ambitious emissions reduction targets. Greens leader Adam Bandt has said he wants a commitment for no new coal mines in Australia.The ALP issued its report Powering Australia in the lead-up to the May 2022 election. In that report, the ALP sets forth its plan to reduce Australia’s GHG emissions while creating jobs and reducing energy costs, and promises to reduce emissions by boosting renewable energy and making electric vehicles cheaper. Labor’s plan calls for increasing the share of renewables in the National Electricity Market to 82% by 2030. Labor also pledges to reduce the public service’s emission to net zero by 2030 and to invest in a New Energy Apprentices and New Energy Skills Program.International Climate PoliticsAustralia’s relative inaction in addressing causes and consequences of climate change under the previous Liberal-National Coalition government was not an asset in its relations with Pacific Island Countries (PICs). In the 2018 Boe Declaration on Regional Security, Pacific Islands Forum leaders reaffirmed that “climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific and our commitment to progress the implementation of the Paris Agreement.” In an address to Pacific Island leaders, Australia’s new Labor Party, Foreign Minister Penny Wong, discussed Australia’s new approach to climate change. She stated, “nothing is more central to the security and wellbeing of the Pacific than climate change.... We have heard the Pacific and we will act—standing shoulder to shoulder with the Pacific as we address the climate crisis.” Australia’s shift on climate change will likely help its relations with PICs at a time of rising geopolitical tensions with China in the region. It should also help facilitate the objectives of the Partners in the Blue Pacific (PBP), an informal mechanism of Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States established in June 2022 to foster “more effective and efficient cooperation in support of Pacific Island priorities,” including the urgent challenge of addressing climate change. Australia has increased its climate finance commitment to AD$2 billion (US$1.37 billion) over the period 2020-2025, with AD$700 million (US$481 million) of that figure to be spent on climate adaptation and resilience, disaster preparedness, and renewable energy projects in the Pacific. Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are the primary way in which countries who are parties to the Paris Agreement (PA) communicate their own contribution to meeting the goals of the PA. Under the former Morrison government, Australia’s NDC committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2030. The ALP won the May 2022 election with a platform that included a policy to reduce Australia’s emissions by 43% by 2030 and to keep Australia on track to reach net zero by 2050. In June 2022, the new Labor government updated Australia’s NDC accordingly. One climate advocacy group, the Climate Action Tracker, has observed that while Labor has committed to significant improvements over the previous government, “Australia will need to adopt more ambitious climate policies and take further action to (be) compatible with limiting warming to 1.5°C.... To achieve this the Albanese Government needs to abandon its support for new fossil fuel projects.” Domestic emissions reductions proposed by the Greens and Teal independents align more closely with the 1.5 degree goal.Approach to COP NegotiationsThe previous Morrison government reportedly resisted pressure to set more ambitious targets in the lead-up to the UNFCCC annual Conference of Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, United Kingdom, in 2021.The new Albanese government is reportedly considering joining the global methane pledge, which seeks a 30% reduction in methane emissions by 2030 relative to 2020 levels. By some estimates, 26% of Australia’s GHG emissions were from methane in 2021. The ALP has declared its intention to bid to co-host a future COP summit in Australia with Pacific partner countries. The new ALP government’s shift to undertake more action to address climate change will move Australia more in line with international efforts at future COP meetings. Further development of the Albanese government’s position on climate change may well be influenced by the Green Party and pro-climate action independents, due to the political leverage they now have, particularly in the Senate. Prime Minister Albanese emphasized the importance of acting to address climate change in his remarks to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris in July 2022. Cooperation with the United StatesThe leaders of the United States, Australia, Japan, and India launched a Quad Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Package at their Tokyo meeting in May 2022. The Quad Leaders Joint Statement following the meeting recognized “the urgent need to address climate change as emphasized in the latest IPCC reports,” adding, “we will steadfastly implement the Paris Agreement and deliver on the outcomes of COP26, accelerating our efforts to raise global ambition, including reaching out to key stakeholders in the Indo-Pacific region and supporting, strengthening, and enhancing climate actions by partners in the region including through mobilizing climate finance, both public and private, and facilitating the research, development, and deployment of innovative technology.” The Joint Statement of the December 2022 Australia-U.S. Ministerial Consultations (AUSMIN) emphasized the “need for urgent action on climate change and the importance of a clean energy transition, committing to pursue these as a new pillar of the U.S.-Australia Alliance.”",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IF/PDF/IF12282/IF12282.1.pdf
IF12178,2023-12-05T05:00:00Z,2025-06-21T02:32:42Z,India: Climate Change Issues,"Global climate change presents multiple challenges to India. The country is faced with meeting its energy and economic development needs, reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and addressing the potential impacts of climate change. India is among the world’s top emitters of GHGs, including carbon dioxide (CO2), along with China, the United States, and the European Union; thus, India’s participation in global efforts to mitigate climate change would be crucial to their success. India accounted for 17.5% of the world’s population and 7% of global CO2 emissions in 2021, although its CO2 emissions per capita are comparatively low. Energy use in India has roughly doubled since 2000. The country’s reliance on coal and other fossil fuels results in India emitting more GHGs per unit of energy generated than many other large countries. Impact of Climate ChangeIndia also is increasingly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. According to a 2021 Indian government overview of the country’s National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), “Climate change is one of the most critical global challenges of our times. Recent events have emphatically demonstrated our growing vulnerability to climate change. Climate change impacts will range from affecting agriculture—further endangering food security—to sea-level rise and the accelerated erosion of coastal zones, increasing intensity of natural disasters, species extinction, and the spread of vector-borne diseases.” The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report, Climate Change 2023: Synthesis Report, provides both observations and projections of potential impacts of climate change on India. The report states that observed adverse impacts of climate change on Asia include increased heat, malnutrition, and harm from wildlife; worsening mental health; displacement of people; and flood- and storm-induced damages in coastal areas. Additionally, the report states the following as key risks for Asia: flooding and infrastructure damage; biodiversity loss across freshwater, land, and ocean ecosystems; increase in frequency and extensiveness of coral bleaching; reduced coastal fishery resources; and decreased food and water security. The report also projects that 26% more people will be exposed to sea level rise from 2020 to 2040 in Asia.Domestic Climate PoliciesIndia’s 1.4 billion people and growing middle class continue to create increased energy demands and resulting GHG emissions. According to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) India Energy Outlook 2021, to meet projected growth in electricity demand over the next 20 years, India would need to add a power system the size of the European Union’s. Rapid industrialization and urbanization likely will continue to create large energy demands, perhaps most notably in the area of space cooling.By many accounts, transition away from coal to renewables is among the most important tasks facing Indian leaders as they address climate change and reform India’s energy sector. Coal accounts for roughly half of India’s total installed generation capacity. Both IEA and Indian government officials project that India will continue to rely on coal as a primary source of energy, even as coal’s share of power generation may decline. In 2022, India’s Minister of Coal, Mines, and Parliamentary Affairs reportedly stated that “no transition away from coal is happening in the foreseeable future in India,” with coal expected to play a central role in India’s energy mix beyond 2040. At the same time, India’s renewable energy sector is growing rapidly, and the potential exists for further expansion of this sector, including with solar, wind, and hydropower sources.Selected Climate Change Policy Initiatives in IndiaIn addition to efforts outlined in the NAPCC and India’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), the IEA has identified the following announced policy initiatives as key to reducing India’s emissions:Net Zero Emissions by 2070 (announced in 2021);Renewable energy and transmission targets, including aims to raise power generation from non-fossil sources to 50% of all capacity (from 42% at present) and achieve 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030;Production-Linked Incentives, such as subsidies toward creation of new manufacturing of solar photovoltaic (PV) modules and modern batteries;a National Green Hydrogen Mission funded with $2.3 billion to support production, use, and exports targeted at five million tons annually; anda Carbon Market authorized by India’s Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2022, which allows the government to provide for a carbon-trading scheme.Source: International Energy Agency, World Energy Outlook 2023India’s pledge to attain 500 gigawatts (GW) of non-fossil fuel energy generation by 2030 will require more than doubling current capacity of 186 GW (including 7.5 GW from nuclear power). Over half of this targeted addition is to come from the solar sector. According to the Ministry of Power, 72 GW of solar photovoltaic currently accounts for about 17% of India’s total installed capacity. A National Solar Mission, one of the eight Missions under India’s NAPCC, targets 100 GW of grid-connected solar power by 2030. With 44 GW at present, wind power accounts for 10% of total capacity; the government aspires to generate 150 GW from wind by 2030. Including hydropower, renewable energy sources now provide 42% of India’s total installed capacity. Approach to COP NegotiationsAt COP27, India announced the submission of their Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) to the UNFCCC. This document outlines how they will meet their decarbonization pledge announced in 2021. The six key areas of India’s LT-LEDS are energy security, transportation, urbanization, industrial sectors, forestry, and climate finance. India has for decades argued that developed countries caused the current climate crisis and should thus take the bulk of responsibility for mitigating it, and that developed countries should also support developing countries’ climate mitigation efforts financially and technologically. The LT-LEDS and press release announcing the LT-LEDS emphasize this point. The LT-LEDS says there are “shortcomings in the scope, scale, and speed of the climate finance made available to developing countries from developed countries” and “shortcomings in defining, tracking, and reporting” climate finance. The documents also state that climate finance is skewed toward mitigation rather than adaptation, “with adverse implications for developing countries facing climate-induced disasters.” In his speech at the COP26 summit in 2021, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “India expects developed countries to make $1 trillion available as climate finance as soon as possible. As we track the progress of climate mitigation, we must also track climate finance.” Ahead of COP28, India and the UAE released a joint statement on climate change, urging Parties to the Paris Agreement to operationalize the loss and damage fund established at COP27. This fund is intended to be used by low-income countries to cope with the financial impacts of climate change. Loss and damage is a key focus area of debate between developing and developed countries at COP28.Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)India updated its NDC in August 2022 ahead of COP27. The NDC states India will reduce the emissions intensity of its gross domestic product by 45% by 2030 from 2005 levels. The update also includes a pledge to derive 50% of the country’s electric power from non-fossil fuel-based resources by 2030. India’s NDC pledge does not include a quantifiable target for 2030 emissions. The IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2023 projects India’s CO2 emissions will rise nearly 30% by 2050, one of the largest country increases.Cooperation with the United StatesThe Biden Administration has expressed support for India’s goal of installing 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030 and its long-term vision to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. In 2021, President Biden and Prime Minister Modi established the U.S.-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership with two tracks. The first, a Strategic Clean Energy Partnership (SCEP), “focuses government, industry, and other stakeholder efforts to advance energy security, clean energy innovation, and decarbonization efforts to support the energy transition while ensuring clean energy access.” The Department of Energy is the lead U.S. agency. SCEP works on five “pillars”: Responsible Oil and Gas; Power and Energy Efficiency; Renewable Energy; Sustainable Growth; and Emerging Fuels and Technology. Under the SCEP, a new Renewable Energy Technology Action Platform (RETAP) met for the first time in August 2023. The two governments are also seeking to increase minerals security cooperation to advance shared clean energy goals, including through the Minerals Security Partnership.During a 2021 visit to New Delhi, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry joined Indian officials in launching the second track of the partnership: a bilateral Climate Action and Finance Mobilization Dialogue, with the Departments of State and the Treasury as lead U.S. agencies. U.S. efforts include a $500 million U.S. International Development Finance Corporation loan to build solar panels in India. This mechanism has seen limited success to date, and India is able to finance only a small percentage of the $100 billion or more it reportedly will need annually to meet its net-zero by 2070 goal. Kerry, at a July 2023 G20 meeting on climate issues, said, “[We] have an imperative [at COP28] to try to establish a better finance track in order for emerging economies and less developed countries to be able to make the transition.”The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or “Quad” is another mechanism through which the United States and India—along with Japan and Australia—are undertaking initiatives to address climate change. In 2022, Quad leaders launched a new “Quad Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Package” to enhance climate and clean energy cooperation, as well as promote adaptation and resilience. Among other developments at a May 2023 Quad summit meeting, the four leaders issued a Statement of Principles on Clean Energy Supply Chains in the Indo-Pacific and announced a Clean Energy Supply Chains initiative designed to accelerate the region’s clean energy transition.In the 118th Congress, S. 1720, the Indo-Pacific Strategic Energy Initiative Act—“To provide support for energy infrastructure projects in the Indo-Pacific region,” including India—was introduced in May 2023. If enacted, this bill would provide political and diplomatic support for new energy infrastructure projects, particularly natural gas.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IF/PDF/IF12178/IF12178.5.pdf
R47583,2023-06-01T04:00:00Z,2025-06-21T01:29:20Z,Is That Climate Change? The Science of Extreme Event Attribution,"Climate change attribution is the study of whether, or to what degree, human influence may have contributed to extreme climate or weather events. Scientists can now estimate whether human activities have influenced extreme weather or climate events and changed how likely they are to occur. This is known as the science of climate change attribution. Attributions of extreme weather to human-induced climate change may affect how policymakers, organizations, and individuals understand and manage associated risks, with the potential benefit of avoiding future costs. The interpretation and evaluation of attribution findings have been part of the discussion of policy on wildfires, heat waves, climate change, and disaster responses, among other issues. Understanding the attribution process and its uncertainties may be helpful in understanding the potential uses and limitations of climate attribution claims. Before the development of extreme event attribution methods, there was a scientific consensus that, while attribution of global climate trends was possible, attribution of individual events was not possible. This changed with the development of statistical methods to determine the likelihood that human influence had changed the frequency or severity of extreme events, and a better understanding of the connections between components of the Earth’s climate system. Several approaches to extreme event attribution have been developed, including a risk-based approach, which seeks to estimate human-influenced changes in the probability of an extreme event, and a storyline approach, which seeks to estimate the relative contribution of specific natural and human causes to an extreme event. The two approaches use many of the same analytic tools. Researchers may study different aspects of the same event, or use differing yet valid analytic methods and find results that seem inconsistent. Numerous attribution studies have been completed on a wide range of extreme events, including heavy rainfall, heat waves, sea ice extent, consecutive dry days, droughts, and others. Results have included instances where changes in event probability were attributed to human influence, instances where evidence of human influence was not found, and instances where the results were inconclusive. For example, a study of record high May 2017 temperatures in South Korea found that the increased probability of such an event was due to human influence, while a study of a 2011 drought/heat wave in Texas did not find evidence of human influence. In recent years, domestic litigation has been brought by states and municipalities seeking compensation for damage caused by adverse climate impacts. Extreme event attribution may become important in this type of litigation in order to establish liability. Attribution science is subject to uncertainty. Sources of uncertainty include uncertainty in the observational data, uncertainty in the scientific understanding of natural climate variability, and uncertainty in results produced by climate simulation models. Researchers address these uncertainties using model standardization as well as statistical and analytic methods. The Chips and Science Act (P.L. 117-167) includes provisions for “the development of software and algorithms to enable the productive application of environmental systems and extreme weather in climate and Earth system prediction models.” In the 118th Congress, the Earth Act to Stop Climate Pollution by 2030 (H.R. 598) includes the finding that “[t]he United States is already seeing climate change exacerbate extreme weather events.” A concurrent resolution (S.Con.Res. 9) includes the finding “that climate change is already increasing the frequency of extreme weather.” Other legislative proposals such as the Green New Deal for Health Act (H.R. 2764) and the Food and Farm Act (H.R. 1824) also include findings stating a causal link between climate change and some extreme weather events.Climate change attribution has been cited in congressional hearings regarding wildfires, disaster preparedness and the role of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, extreme heat, the impacts of climate change, and the Department of Homeland Security, among other issues. In some cases, experts have disagreed as to the attribution of the same set or type of events. Climate attribution science may help Congress understand related policy issues and evaluate testimony and information presented in hearings and from other sources.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R47583/R47583.1.pdf
R47551,2023-05-09T04:00:00Z,2025-06-21T01:25:15Z,Solar Geoengineering and Climate Change,"Solar geoengineering (SG) refers to a set of methods aimed at cooling the Earth in order to counteract the warming effects of increases in greenhouse gases (GHGs). Interest in SG has developed due to concerns that current strategies of climate change mitigation, primarily through GHG emissions reductions, may not be sufficient to stabilize global temperatures at levels quickly enough to avoid adverse climate impacts resulting from global warming.The Earth’s energy budget is the ratio of energy entering the Earth’s climate system in the form of shortwave solar radiation and the energy leaving the Earth’s climate system either as reflected shortwave radiation energy or reradiated longwave heat radiation energy. SG methods seek to offset global warming by either reducing the amount of energy coming into the system from the sun, or increasing the amount of energy lost from the system to space.Three SG methods are discussed in this report: stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), marine cloud brightening (MCB), and cirrus cloud thinning (CCT).SAI seeks to reproduce the cooling effect of volcanic eruptions by injecting sulfates into the stratosphere, to form a reflective aerosol. There is uncertainty about the method’s degree of cooling, the potential effect on the Earth’s climate, and concern about damage to the Earth’s protective stratospheric ozone layer.MCB seeks to increase the reflectivity of low-altitude oceanic clouds, reducing incoming solar energy and having a cooling effect, by spraying a mist of seawater into such clouds. Some studies indicate that MCB could offset the warming of a doubling of atmospheric CO2 (a common metric of climate sensitivity) and others indicating that it could not. Some climate modeling studies suggest that MCB could affect global precipitation, with other studies yielding mixed regional effects. CCT differs from SAI and MCB in that rather than decreasing the amount of incoming energy, CCT attempts to increase the amount of outgoing energy. High-altitude cirrus clouds prevent some longwave outgoing heat energy from reaching space. CCT adds an aerosol to the clouds to thin them, allowing more longwave heat energy to escape. Research on CCT effectiveness has produced mixed results, with some researchers finding a cooling effect and others not.Although some international agreements include sections on geoengineering, there is no international agreement exclusively governing SG research and implementation. Governance of SG is an area of active discussion for researchers and policymakers. As of the publication of this report, Congress has not passed legislation that exclusively regulates or governs SG research or implementation; however, there are aspects of some U.S. statutes that may be relevant. For FY2022, Congress appropriated funds for the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to form an interagency task force in cooperation with other federal agencies, whose mandate includes the establishment of a research governance framework for publicly funded SG research. The OSTP has solicited public comments on rapid climate intervention research, including research on SG.Some scientists have stated that the scientific understanding of SG is not currently sufficient to consider implementation. Some commentators have raised the concern that the perceived availability of SG may be seen as an alternative to mitigation strategies, such as emissions reductions, and delay or reduce efforts at such reductions.Congressional deliberations on SG policy may include an evaluation of trade-offs between benefits and risks. On the one hand, SG may provide a cooling effect to offset global warming, reducing the risk of adverse climate change effects. On the other hand, risks associated with SG include possible damage to stratospheric ozone, reductions in precipitation, and reduction of ocean primary productivity. There is uncertainty about the climate response to SG, including the possibility of adverse impacts at global and regional levels. There may also be a risk of unilateral action on SG by countries or nonstate actors in the absence of U.S. law or an international agreement specifically addressing SG.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R47551/R47551.2.pdf
R47082,2022-04-29T04:00:00Z,2025-06-20T23:36:29Z,Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: Sixth Assessment Report,"In 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis—Contribution of Working Group I, as part of its Sixth Assessment (AR6 WGI). The role of the IPCC as endorsed by the United Nations in plenary session in 1988 is “to provide internationally coordinated scientific assessments of the magnitude, timing and potential environmental and socio-economic impact of climate change and realistic response strategies.” This CRS report serves as a primer for the AR6 WGI assessment. It is not comprehensive, instead presenting key findings pertinent to congressional consideration of risks related to natural and human-induced climate change and possible legislative responses. The AR6 WGI presents current evidence of changes in the climate, including, but not limited to, the following: Global average surface temperature in 2011-2020 increased by approximately 1.0oC above the preindustrial period of 1850-1900; heatwaves have occurred more often and with greater intensity since the 1950s, while cold extremes have occurred less often in the same time period; scientists have high confidence that there has been a global increase in co-occurring droughts and heatwaves since 1950; terrestrial global average precipitation has increased, as has the frequency of heavy precipitation events; Arctic sea ice has decreased, while Antarctic sea ice has remained largely unchanged.The AR6 report reinforces earlier IPCC scientific assessments that human activities are the primary driver of many of these observed changes. The new report concludes, “It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land.” While climate change is the result of human and natural climate drivers, greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by human activity have had the greatest effect, including the observed increase in global average surface temperature. Since the release of the 2014 IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), information on climatic change has continued to accumulate, supporting greater scientific certainty regarding some aspects of this change. As the AR6 WGI Summary for Policy Makers states, “Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since AR5.”The AR6 WGI provides five emissions scenarios based on a wide range of assumptions about the future, covering socioeconomic behavior, technologies and resources, and possible efforts to mitigate GHG emissions, deforestation, air pollution, and other contributors to climate change. The two highest GHG emissions scenarios are associated with mean projected temperature increases of greater than 3.5oC (all increases are for the period 2081-2100 relative to 1850-1900). Mean projected temperature increases for the two lowest GHG emissions scenarios are below 2oC. A middle scenario, which some associate as closest to current policy trajectories, has a best-estimate increase of 2.7oC. The two lowest emissions scenarios are both based on net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (CO2 emissions entirely offset by CO2 removals) after 2050, and thereafter negative emissions, in which CO2 removals are greater than CO2 emissions and the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere decreases. Net-zero CO2 emissions and negative CO2 emissions do not occur in the other, higher emissions scenarios. Only the two lowest GHG emissions scenarios, with substantial GHG mitigation assumed, result in stabilizing the increase in global mean temperature, while the other emissions scenarios are still on an ascending temperature trajectory at 2100. The AR6 WGI states the physical science basis of limiting climate change: “From a physical science perspective, limiting human-induced global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative CO2 emissions, reaching at least net zero CO2 emissions, along with strong reductions in other greenhouse gas emissions.” Congress may wish to exercise its oversight authorities in examining national progress toward fulfilling the updated U.S. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to mitigating climate change and consider options for shaping and funding the U.S. approach to the Paris Agreement commitments.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R47082/R47082.3.pdf
IF11921,2022-03-04T05:00:00Z,2025-06-20T23:23:25Z,Surface Transportation and Climate Change: Provisions in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58),"Surface transportation is a major source of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, one of the main greenhouse gases (GHGs) contributing to climate change. The effects of climate change, such as extreme heat and sea level rise, also pose a threat to highways, bridges, and public transportation infrastructure. Congress reauthorized the surface transportation programs as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA; P.L. 117-58). The IIJA included mitigation policies and programs aiming to reduce GHG emissions from surface transportation and adaptation policies and programs aiming to make the surface transportation system less vulnerable and more resilient to the impacts of actual or expected future climate change. As with previous authorization acts, the IIJA funded surface transportation programs from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). The IIJA also provided funding with a multiyear advance appropriation from the Treasury general fund.Transportation and GHG EmissionsThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that since 2017, transportation has emitted more GHGs than any other sector of the U.S. economy. In 2019, prior to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, transportation accounted for approximately 29% of the total (Figure 1). Total GHG emissions from transportation were about 5% less in 2019 than in 2005, but increased each year from a recent low in 2012 through 2018, in part because of increased passenger travel and goods movement; the effects of greater vehicle mileage have been somewhat mitigated by improvements in fuel efficiency. There was a slight reduction in transportation emissions in 2019, but a 14% drop in 2020 due largely to disruptions caused by the pandemic.Mitigating GHG Emissions from Surface TransportationEconomists generally agree that broad, market-based policies, such as a cap and trade system or carbon tax, are likely to be the most efficient way to reduce GHG emissions across all economic sectors. Motor vehicle fuel taxes might be considered a crude form of carbon tax in surface transportation, and the higher fuel taxes in other countries are associated with lower annual mileage per person and greater use of more fuel-efficient vehicles. In 2020, the average of U.S. state taxes weighted by fuel volume plus the federal tax on a gallon of gasoline was $0.48. This compared with per-gallon taxes of $2.59 in Japan, $3.65 in the United Kingdom, and $4.57 in Italy. Federal taxes on gasoline and diesel in the United States have been collected largely to raise funds for infrastructure construction, not to control GHG emissions. The IIJA extended through FY2028 the collection of the fuels and other taxes that accrue to the HTF.Figure 1. U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Economic Sector, 2000-2020/Source: EPA, Draft Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2020, table 2-10.Several other current federal policies that seek to reduce GHG emissions from transportation are not typically addressed in surface transportation reauthorization legislation, including the IIJA. This includes the regulation of vehicle fuel economy by the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and, by extension, the GHG standards, administered by EPA. These policies, along with tax incentives and grants for the domestic development and manufacture of alternative fueled vehicles, are typically dealt with in energy bills rather than in transportation legislation. Nevertheless, the IIJA contained energy provisions, including funding for a Clean School Bus Program administered by EPA. For more details, see CRS Report R47034, Energy and Minerals Provisions in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58), coordinated by Brent D. Yacobucci.Surface transportation programs reauthorized in the IIJA do in some respects encourage the deployment of alternative-fueled vehicles and a reduction of vehicle miles traveled. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Low and No Emission Vehicle program provides funding for alternatively fueled buses, and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) administers the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program. The original motivation for these programs was to meet air quality goals, but such policies may help reduce GHGs from surface transportation. Adaptation to Climate Change in Surface TransportationImpacts from actual or expected future climate change are likely to include higher average temperatures, greater extremes of temperature, more precipitation overall with an increase in precipitation intensity and greater variation, and a rise in sea level. While the consequences of some of these changes may depend to some extent on other human activities, such as urban development patterns, they are likely to include more frequent periods of extreme heat; fewer days below freezing; more coastal, riverine, and flash flooding; and more droughts and wildfires. Intense precipitation could lead to more mudslides, particularly following droughts and wildfires.Existing surface transportation infrastructure can be vulnerable to climate change because it was constructed for sea level and weather extremes that are being or are likely to be exceeded in the future. If the effects of climate change become more pronounced, as studies anticipate, the impacts of extreme weather on surface transportation infrastructure and operations are likely to increase in magnitude, duration, and frequency. For example, an increase in the number of very hot days could cause more damage to bridges because of greater thermal expansion of bridge joints.“Adaptation” is action to reduce the vulnerabilities and increase the resilience of the transportation system to the effects of climate change. Adaptation and resilience options include structural and nature-based engineering and policy-based activities. For example, highway bridges can be engineered structurally to withstand the threats of higher wind and water. Nature-based engineering may involve reducing climate vulnerabilities through activities such as wetland restoration, artificial reef construction, and beach restoration. Policy-based activities include changing maintenance practices, such as more frequent drain cleaning, and improving plans for weather emergencies.Prior to the IIJA, FHWA had stated that federal highway funds could be used to assess the potential impacts of climate change and to apply adaptation strategies. Likewise, federal transit funding administered by FTA could be used for adaptation projects. Several aspects of federal law, regulation, and policy required state and local agencies that manage surface transportation assets to consider the effects of climate change.Infrastructure Investment and Jobs ActThe IIJA made several changes to law and surface transportation funding programs for mitigation and surface transportation infrastructure adaptation and resilience.MitigationThe IIJA authorized and appropriated increases in funding for public transportation and intercity passenger rail. Some advocates of these provisions assert that this funding could mitigate climate change. This assumes that greater spending will boost rail and bus travel, replacing trips by private motor vehicles and airplanes—something that has been difficult to achieve in the past. Excluding COVID-19 relief and other emergency funding, public transportation program funding was $13.0 billion annually in FY2021, whereas the amount authorized and appropriated in the IIJA was $21.4 billion annually for FY2022-FY2026 (unadjusted for inflation). The Treasury general fund authorization for Amtrak and other intercity rail programs, subject to appropriation, increased from $2.5 billion in FY2021 to an average of $7.2 billion annually for FY2022-FY2026. In addition, the IIJA appropriated $13.2 billion annually for intercity rail programs for FY2022-FY2026.The IIJA also authorized and appropriated an increase in funding for the federal highway program from $47.3 billion in FY2021 to an annual average of $73.1 billion for FY2022-FY2026. This may result in more highway vehicle travel and GHG emissions, but the funding included increases for new and existing highway programs aimed at emissions reductions. For example, funding from the HTF for the existing Transportation Alternatives Program increased from $850 million in FY2021 to an annual average of $1.4 billion for FY2022-FY2026. New mitigation programs and the average annual authorization in the IIJA from the HTF for FY2022-FY2026 wereCarbon Reduction Program: $1.3 billionCharging & Refueling Grant Program: $500 millionReduce Truck Emissions at Port Facilities: $50 millionCongestion Relief Program: $50 million.New programs and the average annual appropriation from the Treasury general fund for FY2022-FY2026 in the IIJA wereElectric Vehicle Charging Formula Program: $1 billionReduce Truck Emissions at Port Facilities: $30 million.Adaptation and ResilienceThe IIJA made several changes to the federal highway program aimed at improving adaptation and resilience. It added definitions of “resilience” and “natural infrastructure” to Title 23 of the U.S. Code. It specifically allowed federal funding to be used for “protective features” designed to mitigate the risk of recurring damage from extreme weather events, flooding, or other natural disasters. The IIJA also allowed states to use up to 15% of their annual apportionment of National Highway Performance Program funding for resilience features for highways or bridges that are not part of the National Highway System.The IIJA also established the Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, Efficient, and Cost-saving Transportation (PROTECT) Program to support adaptation and resilience projects. Funding from the HTF was authorized at an annual average of $1.7 billion.The IIJA also authorized Treasury general funds for some new programs, subject to appropriations. This included $100 million annually for Transportation Resilience and Adaptation Centers of Excellence, $100 million annually for the Healthy Streets Program, and $200 million annually for the Active Transportation Infrastructure Investment Program. Healthy Streets Program grants would be to construct pavement that reflects sunlight, to construct pavement porous to rainwater, and to expand tree cover.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IF/PDF/IF11921/IF11921.4.pdf
IF12300,2023-01-06T05:00:00Z,2025-06-21T06:32:17Z,Indonesia: GHG Emissions and Climate Change Policy,"Introduction The Republic of Indonesia faces multiple challenges related to addressing the effects of climate change and lowering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while also meeting its economic and development needs. Indonesia, an archipelagic nation of approximately 17,000 islands with a population of approximately 276 million, is the world’s fourth most populous nation. According to Climate Watch, Indonesia is among the world’s top emitters of GHGs, ranking fourth in 2019 after China, the United States, and India. Indonesia’s government has expressed concern about the effects of climate change on its development, biodiversity, population, and national security. For example, Indonesia’s environment minister opened the 2022 G20 Joint Environment and Climate Ministers’ Meeting by stating that climate change “would not only wipe out all development progress that has been achieved over the past decades, particularly in emerging economies, but it would also propel us over an environmental tipping point into uncharted territory where no future will be sustainable.” Congress has expressed interest in Indonesia’s commitment and actions to address climate change, which are largely tied to Indonesia’s GHG emissions from land and energy use. Congress also may be called upon by some to appropriate funds and conduct oversight of several new U.S. initiatives aimed at supporting Indonesia’s efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Figure 1. Indonesia CO2e Emissions 1990-2019/Source: Congressional Research Service (CRS) using data from World Resources Institute, Climate Watch Data, Indonesia Profile; and the Indonesian Government’s Enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), 2022.Note: MtCO2e represents million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, which represents the number of metric tons of CO2 emissions with the same global warming potential as 1 metric ton of another greenhouse gas. The unconditional NDC target is the emissions reduction goal Indonesia has committed to reach regardless of outside assistance. The conditional NDC target is the emission reduction goal Indonesia has committed to reach upon receipt of foreign aid. NDC targets include LULUCF (see text) in their CO2e emissions values. Sources of Greenhouse Gas EmissionsAccording to the World Resources Institute (WRI), GHG emissions from energy production and land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) comprise approximately 82% of Indonesia’s total emissions (Figure 1). Emissions from energy largely stem from fuel use (approximately 75%, much of which is from coal-generated energy).The LULUCF contribution to GHG emissions in Indonesia is tied to deforestation. Indonesia lost approximately 28.6 million hectares (mha) of forest cover from 2001 to 2021, of which 95% is expected to be permanent, according to some scientists. (One hectare equals about 2.5 acres.) The primary driver of forest loss is commodity-driven deforestation derived from large-scale timber and oil palm plantations, according to the WRI. The annual rate of forest cover loss in Indonesia decreased from approximately 2.4 mha in 2016 to 0.84 mha in 2021 (Figure 2). Scientists attribute the lower deforestation rate in part to government policies to prevent deforestation and fires.Figure 2. Indonesia Tree Cover Loss 2001-2021/Source: CRS. Data from World Resources Institute, 2022. Note: Dotted line is a three-year moving average. Projected Effects of Climate ChangeAccording to a February 2022 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Indonesia is likely to experience increasing temperatures, increasing frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events, and increasing duration of heat waves by the 2050s. Other projected conditions in Indonesia include rising sea levels relative to subsiding land, increased salinization of coastal aquifers, increased incidence of waterborne disease, decreased marine fish yields, and increased risk of forest fire. Indonesia has the longest coastline in the world, and many of Indonesia’s small, low-lying (less than 10 meters above sea level) islands are threatened with land loss from sea level rise and subsidence by mid-century. Its coastal population is one of the highest in the world, and coastal communities are at increased exposure to flooding events, according to the IPCC. Climate change also may affect food production; a 1° Celsius increase in temperature could significantly reduce rice production and fish stocks in Indonesia.Selected Indonesian Policies on Climate Change Indonesia is planning and implementing actions to address climate change. In the energy sector, roughly 60% of Indonesia’s electricity comes from coal. In 2021, Indonesia pledged not to construct new coal plants; this promise does not affect coal plants already under construction (an estimated additional 13.8 gigawatts of capacity). President Widodo pledged to shut all coal plants by 2056; his second and final term in office is scheduled to end in early 2024. At the 2022 G20 Summit, Indonesia, the United States, and several other countries formed a Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP). The JETP includes a financing package to help Indonesia transition away from coal, increase renewable energy production, and commit to net-zero emissions in its power sector by 2050. Net-zero means Indonesia would emit no more GHG into the atmosphere than it removes. The JETP is expected to invest an initial $20 billion over the next three to five years to accelerate Indonesia’s energy transition. An October 2022 Planning Ministry study estimates Indonesia would need between $150 billion and $200 billion per year over the next nine years to reach net-zero emissions by 2060. Under JETP, Indonesia is to reach its peak emissions and increase its renewable energy target to 34% of all power generation by 2030. As part of the partnership, Indonesia pledged to cap carbon dioxide emissions from its power sector at 290 MtCO2e by 2030, down from a baseline of 357 MtCO2e. Indonesia also signed an agreement with Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo to preserve the three countries’ forests (approximately half of the world’s tropical forests). The agreement calls for a funding mechanism to provide payments to reduce deforestation. Nationally Determined ContributionIn September 2022, Indonesia submitted an Enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This NDC communicates the country’s emission reduction targets and other actions intended to contribute to meeting the collective goals of the Paris Agreement. In its NDC, Indonesia commits to reducing GHG emissions by 31.9% (unconditionally) relative to its business-as-usual (BAU) scenario by 2030 and, conditional upon the receipt of foreign aid, commits to reducing GHG emissions by 43.2% relative to BAU. Figure 1 illustrates these targets compared with Indonesia’s historical GHG emissions. (The percentage reductions for unconditional and conditional actions are based on the estimated BAU in 2030.) Indonesia’s NDC identifies LULUCF—including peat fires—and energy as the two main sectors contributing to its GHG emissions. The NDC specifies a target of restoring 2 mha of peatland and rehabilitating 12 mha of degraded land by 2030 in an effort to reduce emissions. Indonesia plans to continue to implement Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) strategies to achieve its emission reduction targets. The NDC further identifies specific mitigation efforts in the energy sector. Cooperation with the United StatesThe United States provides development assistance to Indonesia that focuses in part on promoting sustainable livelihoods, conserving terrestrial and marine resources, and reducing emissions from LULUCF. All of these initiatives address climate change concerns directly or indirectly. For example, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) supports the Sustainable Environmental Governance Across Regions program, which aims to improve environmental governance and land use practices. In Indonesia by 2026, USAID aims to bring 7 mha of tropical forest and peatland under improved management, reduce 55 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, and mobilize up to $45 million in public and private investments. In addition, USAID is planning a new climate partnership with Indonesia to support carbon sequestration in forests and the conservation of biodiversity, including orangutans, elephants, tigers, and rhinoceroses in Sumatra and Kalimantan. Other countries also are addressing land-use issues in Indonesia; for example, Norway has agreed to pay Indonesia for keeping selected forests intact. In the energy sector, the United States and Indonesia signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to support Indonesia’s plan for low-emissions development. The MOU would allow USAID to share information and exchange knowledge, develop and implement projects, and collaborate on research and activities with Indonesia. (The United States also contributed to the finance deal under the JETP.) In a public-private partnership, ExxonMobil and Indonesian state-owned energy company Pertamina signed a $2.5 billion agreement to develop a carbon capture and sequestration hub in Indonesia.The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC; a U.S. agency that provides grants to countries to promote economic growth, reduce poverty, and strengthen institutions) concluded talks with Indonesia in 2021 to launch a $698 million MCC compact with $649 million from the United States and the rest from Indonesia. The MCC implemented an earlier $500 million compact with Indonesia from 2013 to 2018, with over $300 million allocated for efforts to promote green growth—simultaneously fostering economic development and preserving natural resources. The new compact aims to support climate-conscious transportation infrastructure in five provinces, help mobilize international capital in support of Indonesia’s development goals, support coal plant decommissioning as part of the JETP, and increase access to finance for Indonesia’s women-owned businesses.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IF/PDF/IF12300/IF12300.2.pdf
IF12043,2023-02-14T05:00:00Z,2025-06-21T01:02:00Z,"Heavy-Duty Vehicles, Air Pollution, and Climate Change","In August 2021, the Biden Administration announced plans to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other air pollutants from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and engines through a series of rulemakings over three years (Executive Order 14037 of August 5, 2021, “Strengthening American Leadership in Clean Cars and Trucks,” 86 Federal Register 43583). The first rule, promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in January 2023, set new standards for nitrogen oxides (NOx) and other criteria pollutant emissions for new medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and engines starting in model year (MY) 2027. A second rule, to be promulgated by EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), is expected to set more stringent GHG emission and fuel efficiency standards for the sector beginning with MY2027.Emissions from Heavy-Duty VehiclesThe medium- and heavy-duty vehicle and engine sector (defined at 40 C.F.R. §1037 and 49 C.F.R. §523) generally includes tractor-trailers, vocational vehicles, buses, and heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans. EPA reports that “pollution from heavy-duty trucks contributes to poor air quality and health across the country, especially in overburdened and underserved communities.” These vehicles are the largest contributor to mobile source emissions of NOx (about 32% in 2017, the most recently available inventory; NOx reacts in the atmosphere to form ground-level ozone, or smog), as well as particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and air toxics. Further, according to EPA’s Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2019 (published April 2021), medium- and heavy-duty vehicles emitted 456.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) in 2019 (about 25% of total CO2 emissions from the U.S. transportation sector).Current StandardsCriteria Pollutant Emission StandardsIn January 2023, EPA finalized the current set of emission standards for criteria, or common, pollutants from heavy-duty vehicles and engines (88 Federal Register 4269) through its authorities under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The new standards, to begin in MY2027, would require original equipment manufacturers to reduce tailpipe emissions of NOx by approximately 80% and particulate matter by 50%, compared with the previous standards, and increase the regulatory useful life period of vehicles by 1.5-2.5 times and the emissions warranty period by 2.8-4.5 times, depending on the class of vehicle. The rule requires manufacturers to better ensure engines and emission control systems work properly on the road for a longer period of time and to demonstrate that engines are designed to prevent vehicle drivers from tampering with emission control devices. EPA estimated that by 2045, the rule would result in, inter alia, up to 2,900 fewer premature deaths; 18,000 fewer cases of childhood asthma; and $29 billion in annual net benefits. EPA also estimated the technology required to meet the new rule will cost between $2,500 and $8,300 per vehicle.On February 9, 2023, S.J.Res. 11 was introduced in Congress, providing for disapproval of EPA’s January 2023 heavy-duty vehicles rule under the Congressional Review Act. Sponsors of the resolution state that the new standards are overly challenging to implement, would make the cost of new trucks prohibitive for small business owners (potentially increasing pollution by incentivizing operators to keep older, higher-emitting trucks on the road for longer), and would increase supply chain costs. Greenhouse Gas Emission StandardsIn October 2016, EPA and NHTSA jointly published the current set of GHG emission and fuel efficiency standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and engines (81 Federal Register 73478) through their authorities under the CAA and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140). These standards, referred to as Phase 2, expanded on the Phase 1 standards (promulgated in September 2011, for MY2014 through MY2018; 76 Federal Register 57106) and introduced first-ever controls on trailers (the part of the vehicle pulled by the tractor—since vacated) and glider vehicles (a new chassis combined with an older engine). The standards phase-in between MY2021 and MY2027 for engines and vehicles and between MY2018 and MY2027 for gliders (see Figure 1).The Phase 2 rule maintained the underlying regulatory structure developed in Phase 1, such as the general categorization of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and the separate standards for engines and vehicles. It also retained the Phase 1 averaging, banking, and trading compliance provisions and its flexibilities for small businesses. However, unlike Phase 1, the rule established “technology-advancing standards”—standards based not only on currently available technologies but also on utilization of technologies under development or not widely deployed. These could include advancements in the engine, transmission, driveline, aerodynamic design, lower rolling resistance tires, and extended idle reduction technologies.The Phase 3 proposal, announced in Executive Order 14037, is scheduled for release in the spring of 2023.Figure 1.

Selected IssuesSome selected issues from the Phase 2 GHG rulemaking that have remained of interest to Congress include the following:Trailer ProvisionsThe Phase 2 rule included standards for both engine emissions and the vehicle as a whole, including requirements for improvements to the aerodynamics of freight trailers. In November 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit granted the Truck Trailer Manufacturing Association’s petition for review, holding that EPA cannot regulate trailers under CAA Section 202(a) because trailers are not “self-propelled” motor vehicles. A majority of the three-judge panel also held that NHTSA does not have authority to regulate trailers under EISA because trailers use no fuel.Racecar ProvisionsIn the Phase 2 proposal, EPA included language that was intended to clarify tampering provisions with respect to nonroad vehicles. Industry groups claimed that the provisions would prevent owners from modifying motor vehicles used exclusively for racing. EPA removed the language from the final rule. Nevertheless, some argue that the underlying compliance uncertainty remains. Legislation to clarify it has been proposed in several Congresses (most recently H.R. 3281/S. 2736 in the 117th Congress). In December 2016, the Racing Enthusiasts and Suppliers Coalition filed a petition with the D.C. Circuit to address the uncertainty. On August 12, 2022, the three-judge panel dismissed the petition for review.Glider Kit and Glider Vehicle ProvisionsThe term glider kit is used in the vehicle industry to describe a chassis and cab assembly that is produced without a new engine, transmission, or rear axle. A third party then typically installs used parts to complete the assembly. Historically, gliders have been used as a means to salvage valuable components from vehicles that were badly damaged in collisions. Prior to the Phase 2 rulemaking, EPA and NHTSA observed a sharp increase in glider sales, suggesting to them that gliders were being used to circumvent standards for safety and emissions (e.g., NOx and particulates). For this reason, EPA moved to apply current emission standards to gliders under the Phase 2 rule. In July 2017, several glider kit manufacturers filed a petition for reconsideration with EPA, arguing that gliders should not be considered “new motor vehicles” under the CAA, and that EPA thus lacked the authority to regulate them. In November 2017, EPA issued a proposed repeal of the requirements (82 Federal Register 53442). Upon review, the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs reportedly informed EPA that the agency needed a regulatory impact analysis before it could finalize the repeal. In July 2018, EPA announced an 18-month enforcement pause on the Phase 2 production limits for glider vehicles as it reconsidered the rule. No further action has been taken since.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IF/PDF/IF12043/IF12043.6.pdf
IF12324,2023-02-09T05:00:00Z,2025-06-21T02:42:43Z,Loss and Damage Associated with the Effects of Climate Change: Recent Developments,"Repeated scientific assessments have concluded, with increased confidence over time, that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with human activities have led to rising global temperatures and other changes to the climate. Small changes to the climate may bring benefits to some entities and adverse effects to others. Ongoing climate change would be increasingly adverse, and potentially catastrophic, for a widening scope of populations and ecosystems. Both slow onset changes (e.g., desertification) and extreme events contribute to an array of losses and damages. Many low-income countries, especially small island states, have long sought assistance and recourse through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992) and its subsidiary Paris Agreement (PA, 2015) to cope with climate change-related loss and damage. In the early 1990s, some negotiators of the UNFCCC proposed means to address loss and damage that were not adopted. Now, many Parties and stakeholders view addressing loss and damage as the “third pillar” of climate action, along with GHG mitigation and adaptation. Loss and damage was first adopted in a negotiated UNFCCC text at the 13th Conference of the Parties (COP13) in 2007, in Bali, Indonesia. Negotiations on “new funding arrangements” to address loss and damage began, for the first time, in November 2022 at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. While COP27 decided to establish “new funding arrangements” and “a fund,” these items are largely procedural: they call for a series of meetings and reports in 2023, with potential decisions among Parties to operationalize both the new funding arrangements and the fund expected at COP28 in November 2023. Many expect delivery of funding shortly thereafter, if not before. Decisions that Parties make under the PA may lead to expectations that the U.S. government would pledge or provide funding to address loss and damage. Members of Congress may convey views to the executive branch about the merits, scope, structure, eligible recipients and uses of funds; criteria and priorities; and other choices that Parties are to consider in 2023 and beyond. Views may concern whether to authorize contributions to a fund or other means of assistance and/or whether to appropriate funding. Sharm el-Sheikh: New Funding Arrangements Established and, in That Context, a FundAt COP27, the Parties agreed to put on the conference agenda the issue of funding arrangements to address loss and damage associated with the effects of climate change. Developing countries—the large majority of Parties—had insisted the meeting address the topic in order to proceed.  The Parties concluded two decisions with provisions regarding loss and damage: (1) the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan, and (2) a decision specifically regarding funding arrangements for responding to loss and damage. Among items in the latter, the Parties decided to establish new funding arrangements for assisting developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, in responding to loss and damage, including with a focus on addressing loss and damage by providing and assisting in mobilizing new and additional resources, and that these new arrangements complement and include sources, funds, processes and initiatives under and outside the Convention and the Paris Agreement; [and] in the context of establishing the new funding arrangements [ ... ], to establish a fund for responding to loss and damage whose mandate includes a focus on addressing loss and damage[.]Two other initiatives were launched at COP27 to address loss and damage, the Global Shield Against Climate Risks, largely an insurance and capacity-building approach, and the United Nations Secretary General’s Early Warnings for All, to extend early warning systems to all countries, particularly in Africa.Not Liability, Compensation, or ReparationsDespite portrayals by some stakeholders and media, the language in the Sharm el-Sheikh decisions does not connote new funding arrangements to be “liability,” “compensation,” or “reparations.” The U.S. delegation and others have consistently and successfully opposed inclusion of these concepts in negotiated texts. In the PA, Article 8 concerns loss and damage and emphasizes cooperation through the Warsaw Mechanism for Loss and Damage Associated with Climate Change Impacts (WIM). The Parties agreed in the corresponding 2015 decision to adopt the PA that “Article 8 of the [Paris] Agreement does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation.” In accordance, the language agreed in Sharm el-Sheikh makes no reference to liability or compensation. While some stakeholders, including some governments, continue to press for establishing compensation, liability, or reparations under the UNFCCC, many do not, including many developing countries seeking assistance. Outside of the UNFCCC processes, nonetheless, several small island states are making efforts toward seeking legal judgments based on alleged liability under international law. Sorting Out Existing and New ArrangementsThe Sharm el-Sheikh decisions to establish new funding arrangements and a fund for loss and damage add to existing and past processes. One task for 2023 is to evaluate and propose relationships and coordination among them. Parties established the WIM in 2013 to enhance knowledge, dialogue, and action and to provide support for addressing loss and damage, including regarding risk management. While many Parties consider the WIM useful for developing and sharing information, many also view its functions—as instituted—to be limited, particularly in supporting actions to address loss and damage effectively. Parties mandated the Suva Expert Dialogue in 2018 to explore information and views on ways to facilitate mobilization and securing of expertise and enhancement of support, including finance, technology and capacitybuilding to address loss and damage. Among its findings, the Suva report concluded that “[f]inancing should target disaster preparedness, including early action, so that policymakers move from a position of risk responders’ to that of risk managers.’” It highlighted the value of sustained investments to address challenges in risk assessment, local capacities, and intergovernmental coordination, among others. Regarding finance issues, it concluded that levels of finance were insufficient to implement risk reductions, along with the challenges of indebtedness of some developing countries and timing of financial flows following disasters. The Suva final report highlighted risk transfer and finance options, such as insurance, while noting issues of accessibility and affordability. It identified existing and potential financial mechanisms, including the Financial Mechanisms of the UNFCCC—the Green Climate Fund and the Global Environment Facility. Parties recognize that funds also have flowed through, and continue to flow through, humanitarian assistance and recovery efforts after disasters.In 2019, Parties established under the WIM the Santiago Network for Averting, Minimizing, and Addressing Loss and Damage. Its role is to catalyze technical assistance to support approaches at the local, national, and regional levels to address loss and damage. The 2021 COP26 established the Glasgow Dialogue to “discuss the arrangements for the funding of activities to avert, minimise and address loss and damage.” While this dialogue continues, the pressure on negotiations regarding finance to address loss and damage led to the COP27 decisions to establish new funding arrangements and a fund.The Sharm el-Sheikh decision provides that the “new arrangements complement and include sources, funds, processes and initiatives under and outside the Convention and the Paris Agreement.” The decision tasks a Transitional Committee with, among other things, “identifying and expanding sources of funding” and “ensuring coordination and complementarity with existing funding arrangements.” It tasks the Secretariat with producing a report that identifies relevant existing funding arrangements and innovative sources, among other topics. Potential Providers and Recipients of FundingThe COP27 decisions do not identify who might provide new and additional funding either through (1) the new funding arrangements “for assisting developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change” or (2) the fund established in that context. The COP27 decisions do not suggest that providing funding would be mandatory for any Party, which is consistent with other financial commitments under the UNFCCC. Frequently cited potential sources of new funding to address loss and damage include governments of relatively high-income Parties, such as the United States and the European Union. Other proposed candidates include China, Saudi Arabia, and other countries that emit relatively high levels of GHG emissions either within their boundaries or indirectly through sales of fossil fuels. Additional candidates include nongovernmental sources, such as philanthropies, businesses, and others.The language in Sharm el-Sheikh decisions appears to limit provision of new funding to developing countries (not defined under the UNFCCC) that are “particularly vulnerable” to the adverse effects of climate change. Many consider that such a scope would not include countries such as China. Options and perspectives may be elucidated in the 2023 processes and may be addressed in COP28 decisions. Estimates of Loss and Damage Associated with the Adverse Effects of Climate ChangeThere is broad consensus among countries and experts that human-induced climate change is already resulting in losses and damages to humans and ecosystems. There is also broad agreement that some particularly vulnerable populations in developing countries have inadequate resources to avert or respond to loss and damage and that the magnitude of losses and damages may be impeding the development of some economies. There is not agreement on the magnitude of loss and damage under discussion in the UNFCCC framework. While estimates exist—some as high as several trillion dollars annually by 2050—many scope and methodological differences and questions remain. For example, how would future loss and damage be contingent on efforts to abate GHG emissions and to adapt to anticipated climate change? Which countries might be included in cost estimates? How could one attribute costs to climate change versus other contributing phenomena, such as growing populations in high-risk locations? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2022 called loss and damage estimates “highly speculative” until methodological questions are resolved.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IF/PDF/IF12324/IF12324.5.pdf
R47262,2023-10-26T04:00:00Z,2025-06-21T02:25:22Z,Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA): Provisions Related to Climate Change,"On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed H.R. 5376 (P.L. 117-169), a budget reconciliation measure commonly referred to as the “Inflation Reduction Act of 2022” (IRA). IRA contains eight titles, each with some provisions that directly or indirectly address issues related to climate change, including reduction of U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or promotion of adaptation and resilience to climate change impacts. The funding and financial incentives of IRA promote the deployment of low- and no-GHG emission technologies. This deployment would likely reduce or avoid some quantity of GHG emissions compared to baseline projections. A 2023 journal article in Science compared emissions estimates from a number of modeling groups. The groups’ estimates indicated that under baseline conditions (i.e., federal, state, and local policies and practices in place before IRA), U.S. GHG emissions would decrease by 25% to 31% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. The same modeling teams estimated that the IRA provisions would reduce U.S. GHG emissions by 33% to 40% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. The range of estimates from the baseline and IRA scenarios is due to varied assumptions in the models, such as future oil and natural gas prices, among other uncertain factors. Actual GHG emission levels will depend on how the provisions are implemented, the growth rate of the U.S. economy, fuel prices, and a range of other factors.A number of factors will likely play a role in determining the economic effects of IRA and the distribution of these effects across geographic areas, income groups, and communities. These factors include federal implementation of the law, and state, local, and private responses to the financial incentives and provisions in IRA. This report identifies provisions of IRA related to climate change, with abbreviated information about their content and the Congressional Budget Office’s estimates of revenue effects over the period of the law, from 2022 to 2031. The provisions are organized by sectoral sources of GHG emissions:electricity;transportation;fossil fuel resources;buildings and energy efficiency;manufacturing;environment and climate justice; agriculture, forestry, and land conservation;climate research; andcross-cutting.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R47262/R47262.3.pdf
R46743,2021-04-01T04:00:00Z,2025-06-20T22:54:52Z,Climate Change Adaptation: Department of Commerce,"Climate change affects the mission and programs of the Department of Commerce (DOC) and its agencies, and these effects are likely to continue. DOC’s wide-ranging responsibilities include trade enforcement, economic development, innovation support, entrepreneurship and business development, standard setting, environmental monitoring, weather forecasting, marine resources management, and statistical research and analysis. Congress has considered and may continue to consider how climate change may affect the mission and programs of DOC and its agencies. Climate change adaptation includes “adjustments to natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climate change, including increases in the frequency or severity of weather-related disasters.” Congressional and Executive Branch Direction on Climate Change for DOC and Its AgenciesTo date, executive orders and other presidential documents have prompted much of the DOC department-level climate change adaptation activities. Several executive orders since 2009 have directed DOC and other departments on climate change adaptation activities. During his term, President Donald Trump issued executive orders to revoke most of President Barack Obama’s orders related to climate change adaptation. In January 2021, President Joe Biden revoked some of President Trump’s executive orders, effectively reinstating several of President Obama’s executive orders. President Biden’s orders also include new directives related to climate change adaptation.At the agency level, Congress and various Administrations have directed one DOC agency—the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)—to support or implement most DOC climate change adaptation activities. NOAA carries out these activities primarily through supporting research on climate change, its effects, and potential adaptation to the effects, as well as through collecting and sharing climate change data and information. Congress and various Administrations also have directed other DOC agencies, such as the Economic Development Administration, International Trade Administration, National Institute for Standards and Technology, and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, to carry out some climate change adaptation activities. Potential Issues for ConsiderationCongress may consider various issues in relation to DOC’s climate change adaptation activities. For example, there are currently few evaluations of existing DOC climate change adaptation responsibilities, appropriations, and spending, including how activities and spending are prioritized. Congress also may consider adjusting DOC or agency appropriation amounts for adaptation activities relative to their benefits and congressional priorities.Additionally, Congress may weigh whether to codify or modify directives under new or recently reinstated executive orders;define climate change adaptation or similar terms in statute; require agency climate change adaptation strategies to supplement those mandated in executive order provisions; direct priorities for producing, collecting, and sharing adaptation information; and alter financial assistance authorities that support adaptation, among other issues.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R46743/R46743.1.pdf
R46694,2021-02-25T05:00:00Z,2025-06-21T01:15:16Z,Climate Change Adaptation: Department of the Interior,"The Department of the Interior (DOI) and many agencies within it, including the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), National Park Service (NPS), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), are responsible for the administration of most public U.S. lands and waters and the U.S. federal mineral estate, among other responsibilities. DOI agencies administer and manage these resources—which include more than 400 million acres of public lands, parks, refuges, wilderness areas, and more—on behalf of all U.S. citizens. DOI agencies also conduct scientific research that informs the management and care of these lands, waters, and other natural resources. Because DOI has such broad land and resource responsibilities, its operations may be particularly sensitive to changing climate conditions; the effects of climate change may impact many of the resources and activities that DOI administers. As a result, DOI has issued department-wide and agency-specific policies and guidance and undertaken numerous actions (collectively, activities) to address climate change and its effects. At the department level, DOI’s efforts to implement activities aimed at adapting to the effects of climate change have taken numerous forms, including implementing executive orders and issuing secretarial orders and department-wide policies and guidance. Department-wide initiatives also have directed agencies to establish or operate adaptation-related activities, such as the USGS-administered Climate Adaptation Science Centers and the FWS-administered Landscape Conservation Cooperatives. These and other adaptation activities are often in flux, as some orders and policies issued in prior Administrations may be withdrawn or amended in subsequent Administrations. At the agency level—in addition to implementing directives from the department and executive levels—the various agencies and bureaus have issued policies and guidance to inform how programs and staff should or may incorporate climate change adaptation considerations into agency programs, among other activities. For example, certain agencies have published guidance documents and reports that outline how adaptation should be interwoven into on-the-ground administration of agency resources (e.g., the National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System) and programs (e.g., hydroelectric energy production and the conservation of species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act [16 U.S.C. §§1531 et seq.]). Climate-specific administrative actions, including those at the executive, department, and agency levels, may be revoked, modified, or superseded. Some of DOI’s adaptation-related activities have been altered or suspended, and it is not always clear to what extent DOI’s or an individual agency’s day-to-day activities conform with existing adaptation directives.Some Members of Congress may be interested in how DOI and DOI agencies are addressing and instituting activities related to climate change adaptation. Specifically, such interests may include oversight, legislative, and appropriations actions. Congress may introduce legislation directing the department or agencies to explicitly consider or not consider climate change adaptation, provide information, and/or publish reports about department and agency activities. Congress also may direct funding to carry out certain activities as part of the annual appropriations process. This report provides an overview of selected activities that DOI and five agencies within DOI—the BLM, Reclamation, NPS, FWS, and USGS—have undertaken to adapt to the effects of climate change. It focuses on activities related to adapting to the effects of climate change rather than activities focused on mitigating climate change (although attributing activities to adaptation versus mitigation can be difficult at times). For the purposes of this report, adaptation includes activities undertaken to adjust to the experienced or projected effects of climate change, and mitigation includes activities directed at reducing the magnitude of climate change. This report is, in part, an update to a previous CRS report published in February 2015, CRS Report R43915, Climate Change Adaptation by Federal Agencies: An Analysis of Plans and Issues for Congress, and presents information on the state of activities as of the end of 2020.

Gaining increased attention in such discussions are federal efforts to reduce the risks of a changing climate by planning for and adapting to projected climate change, both in federal agency operations and in achieving agencies’ respective missions. Specifically, U.S. foreign assistance agencies—the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Peace Corps, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)—are considering how climate change may affect both overseas programming and internal operations. For example, USAID requires climate assessments at each stage of its program cycle to help ensure that potential climate change or variability does not put development gains at risk. The Peace Corps considers how climate change may affect volunteers’ physical safety.Congress provides funding for and conducts oversight of the foreign assistance agencies’ efforts to mitigate the risk of climate change primarily through annual Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) appropriations measures. Some Members in the 116th Congress have introduced legislation that would codify certain aspects of this work. Although some recent legislation has been considered and passed by one chamber, no stand-alone legislation has been enacted.

R46454,2020-07-17T04:00:00Z,2025-06-20T22:25:41Z,Climate Change Adaptation: U.S. Department of Agriculture,"Congress has debated the significance of global climate change and what federal policies, if any, should be adopted to address it. Federal policies may focus on climate change adaptation—actions taken to avoid the consequences or capture the benefits of climate change—or climate change mitigation—interventions to reduce the sources or increase the sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Policies focused on adaptation can reduce risks associated with climate change at federal agencies (including risks to infrastructure, operations, and mission delivery), including at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Given that agriculture and forestry are already experiencing the impacts of climate change, adaptation policies are particularly important for these sectors.Agriculture and forestry are sensitive to climate change, due to relationships between environmental conditions and the health and growth of plants and animals. Policy choices about practices, technologies, and programs can help determine how effectively the agriculture and forestry sectors adapt to climate change. While farmers, ranchers, and land managers continuously adapt to changing conditions, responses to climate change may require new management practices and technologies.Many policies, programs, and activities at USDA address climate adaptation issues specific to agriculture and forestry. USDA provides federal programs and services related to forestry, farming, ranching, rural development, food, and other areas through its agencies and staff offices. Many USDA agencies and offices conduct programs and activities that address climate change adaptation with respect to their unique missions. At the department level, the Climate Change Program Office (CCPO) coordinates USDA’s response to climate change, and the USDA Climate Hubs work to connect climate adaptation research and practice. CCPO, a component of the Office of the Chief Economist, coordinates within USDA and with other federal agencies and international organizations. As such, it oversees USDA climate change adaptation planning, chairs the USDA-wide Global Change Task Force, oversees departmental GHG accounting, represents USDA to the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), and directs international climate change initiatives. The USDA Climate Hubs are a departmental initiative involving several USDA agencies. The 10 regional hubs provide technical support to agricultural producers and landowners, assess and monitor production risks, conduct research, and engage with stakeholders regarding the effects of climate change on agriculture and forests.USDA agencies that engage on climate change adaptation include those focused on natural resources and conservation (the U.S. Forest Service [FS] and the Natural Resources Conservation Agency [NRCS]); research (the Agricultural Research Service [ARS], the National Institute of Food and Agriculture [NIFA], the Economic Research Service [ERS], and the National Agricultural Statistics Service [NASS]); and production, marketing, and regulatory activities (the Farm Service Agency [FSA], the Risk Management Agency [RMA], and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [APHIS]). Other USDA agencies may address climate change adaptation in more limited ways.FS and NRCS play an outsized role in climate change adaptation activities at USDA. Together, their mandates cover approximately 1.5 billion acres of land, including national forests, national grasslands, and privately owned agricultural land. FS manages the National Forest System, conducts forestry research, and provides technical and financial assistance to state, private, and international forestry agencies. These responsibilities increase its presence in climate change activities beyond those of most other agencies at USDA. NRCS develops and delivers voluntary conservation technical assistance and financial support programs. USDA strategies for climate change adaptation rely heavily on these NRCS activities.Considerations for Congress may include the funding of USDA agencies and programs, the voluntary nature of programs that address climate change adaptation, opportunities to incentivize adaptive decisions, USDA staffing levels and leadership positions, concerns about the independence of climate science at USDA, and the design of USDA risk management programs. Congress may choose to address these issues through exercising its appropriations and oversight responsibilities or through new authorizations or directives.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R46454/R46454.1.pdf

The Department of the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Federal Reserve have each announced new steps: The Treasury’s announcement covers a range of issues including public spending, macroeconomic effects, and international cooperation.The SEC’s addresses investor disclosure requirements relating to climate risks and the classification of funds marketed to investors as environmentally friendly.The Fed’s relates to lending risks for individual financial institutions and to systemic financial risks related to climate change.This Insight provides an overview of these actions and how they interrelate. Background: Financial Sector Climate RisksAn international standard-setting body, the Financial Stability Board, has noted that climate change can affect financial stability and asset prices either through physical risks such as more damaging storms and wildfires or through transition risks in which changes in government policies or market perceptions might lead to sudden asset price changes. By some estimates, assets held by fossil fuel companies globally could drop between $250 billion and $1.2 trillion or become “stranded assets” in a possible transition away from fossil fuels.Estimates of potential losses to the financial sector from physical risks are relatively large. In the housing market, one paper found that, as of 2019, government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guaranteed $6.88 trillion in home mortgage debt without pricing flood risk into their guarantee fees. Almost all insured U.S. flood risk is backstopped by the U.S. government through the National Flood Insurance Program.  There is evidence that investors are already seeking to price climate risks into asset prices. In the roughly $4 trillion U.S. municipal bond market, one paper concluded that counties more likely to be affected by climate change paid more in underwriting fees and initial bond yields when issuing long-term municipal bonds.Recent ActionsTreasuryOn January 27, 2021, the White House issued an executive order promising to expand financing internationally for projects to reduce GHG emissions or promote climate adaptation, and on April 22, 2021, released its International Climate Finance Plan focused on ways to mobilize public and private funds internationally toward climate-friendly goals. That plan involves the Department of the Treasury working with other U.S. government agencies and multilateral development banks to manage climate-related risks internationally. In a July 11, 2021, speech, Secretary Janet Yellen noted the United States would double by 2024 its annual public climate finance for developing countries to about $5.7 billion per year and triple its public finance for climate adaptation to about $1.5 billion. In an April 21, 2021, speech, Yellen detailed how Treasury would look at international cooperation, tax, and macroeconomic policy issues to promote climate goals and stressed the importance of making climate risk disclosures more standardized and clearer. This would enable investors to compare risks across companies and drive capital toward cleaner energy, Yellen noted. Clearer climate disclosures—the purview of regulators such as the SEC—could impact GHG emissions targets if investors demand higher returns for climate risk. Some argue, however, that assessing “actionable” climate risks for investors can be challenging or misguided. Others argue disclosures alone may prove insufficient to mitigate systemic risks. Yellen announced April 19, 2021, the creation of a “climate hub” within Treasury to coordinate three areas: (1) climate transition finance, (2) climate-related economic and tax policy, and (3) climate-related financial risks.Securities and Exchange CommissionSEC Chair Gary Gensler in a July 28, 2021, speech said he had requested the SEC’s staff develop a mandatory climate risk disclosure rule proposal for the commission’s consideration by the end of 2021 to update the agency’s 2010 guidance. Gensler noted that such mandatory disclosures should be “consistent and comparable,” enabling investors to compare both qualitative and quantitative metrics across companies, including those related to GHG emissions, financial impacts of climate change, and progress toward climate-related goals. In February 2021, Allison Herren Lee, then acting SEC chair, directed the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance to enhance its focus on climate-related disclosure in public company filings. The SEC also announced in March 2021 the creation of a “Climate and ESG [Environmental, Social, and Governance] Task Force” within the SEC’s Division of Enforcement to identify misconduct related to funds branded as ESG. In recent years, funds marketed to investors as “ESG” have grown markedly, but there is no universally agreed-upon or legally binding definition of what constitutes an ESG fund. In April 2021, the SEC’s Division of Examinations warned that a review it conducted of ESG funds found a number of misleading statements regarding ESG investing processes and adherence to voluntary global ESG frameworks. Federal ReserveOn January 25, 2021, the Fed announced the creation of an internal Supervision Climate Committee to strengthen its “capacity to identify and assess financial risks from climate change” and “develop an appropriate program to ensure the resilience of supervised firms to climate-related financial risks.” In a March 2021 speech, Fed Governor Lael Brainard announced the creation of a Financial Stability Climate Committee at the Fed to assess and address climate-related risks to financial stability. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Randall Quarles spoke about the Financial Stability Board’s publication of a roadmap for addressing international climate-related financial risks in a July 2021 speech. The FSB roadmap supports coordination of climate disclosures for standard-setting bodies internationally. The Fed announced in December 2020 it had formally joined the Network for Greening the Financial System, a group of over 80 central banks focused on climate-related risks that has begun developing methodologies for conducting climate stress testing. Also, the Fed is co-chairing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Risks.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IN/PDF/IN11666/IN11666.2.pdf
IF11827,2021-05-11T04:00:00Z,2025-06-21T02:56:30Z,"Climate Change: Defining Adaptation and Resilience, with Implications for Policy","Congress has increased its attention to risks that climate variability and change pose to communities, the economy, and other dimensions of society. Legislative provisions related to climate change have referenced resilience or adaptation. Federal, state, and local agencies, and other stakeholders, often intend different meanings when they refer to resilience and climate change adaptation. This product presents selected definitions in use for resilience and climate change adaptation, and describes trends and evolutions in use related to climate change. To assist Congress as it considers proposals to enhance adaptation and resilience, and exercises its appropriations and oversight functions, this product seeks to clarify and identify some of the choices implied by differences among definitions. Terms used and definitions provided in legislation, regulation, and guidance may shape how executive agencies or the courts interpret congressional direction and its implementation. Congress may wish to consider whether to clarify terms in legislation or to give discretion to the executive branch. Statutory language may be broad, precise, or ambiguous.Climate Change Adaptation and ResilienceGrammatically, adaptation is a process, action, or sometimes the result of the action, whereas resilience is a condition or capacity. In practice, the distinctions and relationship between the two terms are more complicated, with numerous definitions used for each. A CRS review of definitions used by federal agencies and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicates that there are notable differences between the two concepts of adaptation and resilience in the context of climate change. Additionally, there are differences among entities in their definitions of a single term. The differences suggest potentially important nuances that may have policy and implementation consequences. Some agencies and stakeholders appear to use adaptation and resilience interchangeably or to poorly distinguish their meanings. Over the past decade, CRS has observed a general shift from a prevalence in federal use of the term climate change adaptation to a rise in the term resilience in the context of climate change. Resilience also has become more prevalent as an objective of risk reduction more generally. The shift in use of the terms in the context of climate change policy may connote change in the concept or approach, a reduction of priority for climate change adaptation, greater integration of climate change risk management into multi-hazard management efforts, or political sensitivity to explicit references to “climate change.” Definitions of Climate Change Adaptation Scientific and programmatic literature defines adaptation in various ways. Below are a few examples among the variety of definitions. The IPCC defines adaptation as[t]he process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects.... (Noble et al. 2014)The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), in its Glossary, defines adaptation as “adjustment in natural or human systems in response to a new or changing environment that exploits beneficial opportunities or moderates negative effects.” The Fourth National Climate Assessment, also associated with the USGCRP, says that “[a]daptation refers to actions taken at the individual, local, regional, and national levels to reduce risks from even today’s changed climate conditions and to prepare for impacts from additional changes projected for the future.”The interagency U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit takes a narrower approach, defining adaptation as “the process of adjusting to new (climate) conditions in order to reduce risks to valued assets.” The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has defined adaptation as “adjustments to natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climate change.” The U.S. Department of Agriculture takes a slightly different approach: “Adaptation refers to the process of finding ways to prepare for and flexibly respond to changes in climate.” The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has long used mitigation as “any sustained action to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from natural hazards and their effects.” Although not described as adaptation, many of FEMA’s mitigation efforts may support adaptation to climate changes. Definitions and Uses of ResilienceThe IPCC, in a 2012 report on disaster risk management, defines resilience as “the ability of a system and its component parts to anticipate, absorb, accommodate, or recover from the effects of a potentially hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner...” The USGCRP Glossary defines resilience as “a capability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from significant multi-hazard threats with minimum damage to social well-being, the economy, and the environment.” The interagency U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit defines resilience as “[t]he capacity of a community, business, or natural environment to prevent, withstand, respond to, and recover from a disruption.” The Department of Defense (DOD) uses a general definition of resilience when addressing climate change adaptation: the “ability to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to changing conditions and withstand, respond to, and recover rapidly from disruptions” (DOD Directive 4715.21). Climate change adaptation and resilience measures are often implemented as part of DOD-wide resiliency efforts carried out by the Military Services. For example, the Air Force approach to “installation resilience” includes assessing and preparing for any event that could disrupt the operations of its installations—be they manmade accidents and attacks, or natural disasters.Congress (in Section 1235(d) of P.L. 115-254) directed FEMA to define for its use the terms resilient and resiliency. The agency has not completed this process.Takeaways from the Variety of DefinitionsExamination of the differences among definitions and uses points to elements that may be important for understanding intentions or for decisionmaking. Some uses appear only to address sudden-onset events, such as hurricanes or flash flooding; others would also encompass slow onset or chronic conditions, such as mean temperature increases, seasonal changes (e.g., change in timing of snowmelt), or shifting ranges of disease-bearing insects.Climate change adaptation seems most often—but not always—associated with new conditions or forward-looking expectations. For both terms, when the objective is forward-looking, adaptation may imply a longer time horizon than resilience.Adaptation often implies altering a system to accommodate persistent or long-term anticipated changes in the climate; this may involve system alterations that may not be necessary to enhance resilience to a static climate condition. Resilience is sometimes (but not always) considered as withstanding a hazard with a return to predisturbance conditions, or “bouncing back.” This can raise questions for federal actions as to whether their objectives are to return a system to its predisaster form or function, or to transform systems more profoundly in order to avoid risks while maintaining welfare or services in an evolving environment. Some in the climate change adaptation community see the desired outcome as systems well adapted to future climate conditions; this may go beyond some resilience concepts. For example, well adapted may entail removing development from a high-hazard location and not merely building hazard resilience. In other words, adaptation may favor removing structures rather than elevating them.Until the 2010s, the climate change policy community used adaptation most often as the potential process of addressing impacts of climate change; it was less often conceived in a context encompassing nonclimate hazards, such as earthquakes. In contrast, resilience is often raised within a scope of multiple climate and nonclimate hazards, and is often used to characterize the capacity of a system (e.g., community, subpopulation, business, or ecosystem).Additionally, resilience appears rarely to incorporate taking advantage of emerging opportunities in a changing climate. Although adaptation is often associated with adjustments to avoid negative consequences, it is also often associated with seeking opportunities and new benefits of change. Implications for CongressGenerally, noting the distinctions between adaptation and resilience, as in the IPCC’s definitions, can help clarify policy implications. Uses may continue to evolve over time. If Congress addresses climate change adaptation or resilience, it may clarify its intent by providing definitions, or leave definitions to federal agencies, or to interpretation by the courts if litigated. Some recent bills include adaptation and resilience in their definitions sections. Executive agencies may promulgate definitions through formal means or use flexible guidance or communications. Using the terms interchangeably may leave confusion and create uncertainty for stakeholders as to scope and federal intent, and may complicate Congress’s oversight and assessments of performance and effect of federal efforts. If Congress addresses objectives and definitions regarding adaptation or resilience, it would face several questions, such as whether the term or terms used are tocover responses to sudden-onset risks or events and/or slow-onset risks, or both?apply to climate change-related risks, or to climate hazards in the context of multiple hazards?be explicit about anticipating and preparing for evolving future risks (i.e., use of climate change projections), or indicate use of historical data or recent climate conditions or risks?include making durable changes in anticipation of current or future conditions, or focus on recovery to predisruption status? allow for transformational change of the underlying system at risk as well as incremental change?seek potentially beneficial opportunities, not just avoid risks or adverse conditions? incorporate social aspects of adaptation and/or resilience, including capacity, equity, and other dimensions? suggest the level of acceptable risk implied in being well adapted or resilient? What is the outcome sought?",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IF/PDF/IF11827/IF11827.1.pdf
IF11815,2021-04-22T04:00:00Z,2025-06-20T23:09:52Z,Climate Change: Selected Federal Economic Development Tools and Policy Considerations,"Social, economic, and ecological risks associated with climate change, such as those documented in the U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment and by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have significant economic development implications. These include increased demand for federal economic development interventions, such as for infrastructure resiliency, and support for labor and economic dislocations resulting from energy transition. This In Focus considers potential federal economic development tools to help address climate change, as well as policy considerations. Climate and Economic DevelopmentClimate change countermeasures take two general approaches: (1) mitigation, to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or enhance GHG removals from the atmosphere; and (2) adaptation, to increase resilience to climate change’s effects. Some measures span both approaches. Economic development activities can also play a role in both. Mitigation options typically target (1) supply-side technologies or physical assets, such as transitioning from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources; or (2) redirecting demand-side consumer choice or social behavior, such as through improved consumer information, GHG pricing mechanisms, or tax incentives for GHG-reducing actions. However, even with globally aggressive actions to abate GHGs, the future global average temperature would likely increase above 1.5o Celsius (from a preindustrial baseline) by mid-century. Therefore, climate change adaptation has become an increasingly bipartisan objective (for example, H.R. 4058 in the 116th Congress). Increases in the frequency and severity of natural disasters has raised congressional awareness of, and interest in, disaster resilience and response. Adaptation could avoid human and societal losses and reduce fiscal risks of federal relief and recovery expenses. Adaptation may include new policies, such as disaster funding reforms, or technologies such as resilient building technologies and other infrastructure. Climate change also creates other changed circumstances, including shifting growing seasons, opening of Arctic navigation routes, and the impetus to develop new technologies. Direct Tools and ProgramsSeveral federal economic development programs have direct application to climate mitigation and adaptation. Renewable Energy IncentivesEnergy infrastructure is a common target for economic development investment. A number of federal agencies and entities provide incentives for research, development, and deployment of renewable energy (RE) systems that reduce emissions. The President’s FY2022 budget requests technology demonstration funding to advance renewable technologies and to support new economic bases and jobs. In existing programs, The Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Rural Energy for America program, first established to support rural economic development, funds energy audits and RE technical assistance for small businesses. See CRS Report R40913, Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Incentives: A Summary of Federal Programs, by Lynn J. Cunningham and Rachel J. Eck.The Department of Energy’s (DOE) State Energy Program funds states to deploy RE and promote energy efficiency. DOE’s Renewable Energy Production Incentive provides payments to eligible facilities to encourage private investment and subsidize initial operations. Energy Transition ProgramsHistorically, the federal government has subsidized (largely via tax policies) fossil fuel and nuclear power industries and electricity generation, though the emphasis of federal investment has shifted over the past decade. See CRS Report R44852, The Value of Energy Tax Incentives for Different Types of Energy Resources, by Molly F. Sherlock. Regions and businesses continue to make major transitions in their energy systems and fuel trade. Transition efforts and considerations include increasing access to reliable energy supplies, developing more efficient energy technologies, and reducing energy poverty; rapid changes in the relative costs of energy technologies and fuels, particularly for certain RE equipment, natural gas, and oil; and the expanding natural gas supply and associated pollution risks. Transitions also relate to various regulatory and financial incentives aimed at decreasing fossil fuel use.Although these transitions are driven primarily by market forces and public policy, they may also be influenced by efforts to curb high-emissions energy uses, such as coal combustion. Several federal programs address the economic impact of the coal industry’s decline, including: the Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization (POWER) Initiative, an Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) program available to applicants within its service area; the Assistance to Coal Communities (ACC) program, provided nationwide by the Economic Development Administration (EDA); anda pilot economic development fund to states for Abandoned Mine Reclamation (AML) efforts.These programs provide assistance to communities affected by the coal industry’s decline. Funding may be used for a variety of economic and community development activities and programs, such as workforce training and development, entrepreneurship and business development, infrastructure, and community capacity. Although the POWER Initiative and ACC address the impacts of the coal industry’s decline, they are not intended to facilitate or incentivize energy transition away from fossil fuels. The EDA’s Nuclear Closure Communities program funds similar uses to address economic dislocation from the nuclear power industry’s decline. See CRS Report R46015, The POWER Initiative: Energy Transition as Economic Development, by Michael H. Cecire; and CRS Report R46266, The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund: Reauthorization Issues in the 116th Congress, by Lance N. Larson.Resiliency and Hazard MitigationThe federal government also promotes resilience in the built environment through various programs. Although often described as risk “mitigation” measures (i.e., to mitigate the future impact of hazards or disasters), they can be considered climate adaptation measures.The Federal Emergency Management Agency provides both pre- and post-disaster mitigation assistance through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), the Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) program, the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, and the Public Assistance (PA) program. FMA and BRIC grants are awarded competitively for pre-disaster investments. HMGP and PA are only available within a presidentially declared disaster area for post-disaster reconstruction, which may include resilience projects. See CRS Insight IN11187, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Hazard Mitigation Assistance, by Diane P. Horn; and CRS Report R46749, FEMA’s Public Assistance Program: A Primer and Considerations for Congress, by Erica A. Lee. Following major disasters, Congress has used the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) authorities to fund long-term disaster recovery (CDBG-DR). In recent years, CDBG-DR appropriations have included dedicated set-asides for relocation assistance and resilience-building to mitigate future disaster risk (CDBG-MIT). For more information, see CRS Report R46475, The Community Development Block Grant’s Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Component: Background and Issues, by Michael H. Cecire and Joseph V. Jaroscak.Permissive Tools and ProgramsWhile some federal programs exist with direct application to climate mitigation or adaptation, other programs also could be used to address climate change.HUD’s CDBG program provides flexible funding which may be used for GHG mitigation and adaptation, such as “green” or resilient infrastructure, energy efficiency, weatherization, and technical assistance. See CRS Report R43520, Community Development Block Grants and Related Programs: A Primer, by Joseph V. Jaroscak. In 2016, for example, HUD required grantees to include climate change considerations as part of CDBG planning (81 Federal Register 90997).The EDA’s Economic Adjustment Assistance and Public Works programs provide flexible funding for a variety of uses, including infrastructure, revolving loan funds, or planning. See CRS Report R41241, Economic Development Administration: A Review of Elements of Its Statutory History, by Julie M. Lawhorn.Active federal regional commissions like the ARC provide flexible economic development grants within their service areas. See CRS Report R45997, Federal Regional Commissions and Authorities: Structural Features and Function, by Michael H. Cecire.USDA offers grants, loans, and credit programs for community and economic development purposes. See CRS Report RL31837, An Overview of USDA Rural Development Programs, by Tadlock Cowan. Policy ConsiderationsCongress may consider several policy options while considering climate and economic development objectives:Consolidate and expand direct climate-relevant economic development programs—such as in energy transition and economic diversification—or provide targeted guaranteed income/employment for climate-related industry dislocations;Adapt large economic development efforts, like CDBG or the EDA’s programs, to include more robust sustainability criteria;Scale intergovernmental economic development models like the federal regional commissions to cover all U.S. regions, with direction and resources to make strategic investments in climate mitigation and adaptation; orLeverage the federal government’s influence and market power to promote climate-sensitive policies, such as in fleet vehicle electrification, broad telework adoption, and sustainability-oriented contracting and procurement.To complement and support such measures, Congress may also assess the effectiveness of strategic research, development, and deployment to reduce GHGs, enhance economic opportunities, and adapt to climate change.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IF/PDF/IF11815/IF11815.2.pdf
R46947,2021-10-28T04:00:00Z,2025-06-20T23:55:08Z,U.S. Climate Change Policy,"The greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere trap radiant energy, warming earth’s surface and oceans. Scientific assessments conclude that GHGs very likely have been the main driver of warming of the earth’s lower atmosphere since 1979. The most recent global assessment projected that surface temperature would continue to rise until at least mid-century even under the lowest GHG emission scenarios considered. A range of actions to mitigate GHG emissions and the risks of climate change (i.e., for adaptation or resilience) are under way or being developed on the international, national, and subnational levels. U.S. federal policymakers and stakeholders have different viewpoints regarding what, if anything, to do about future climate change and related impacts. Brief History of U.S. Climate PolicyHistorically, the United States has demonstrated varying approaches and intent with regard to addressing climate change generally and to participating in GHG abatement under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). International negotiations led to, among other agreements, the adoption of the Paris Agreement (PA) in 2015. President Obama accepted the PA without submitting it to the Senate for advice and consent, and the United States became a Party to the agreement when the PA entered into force in 2016. President Trump announced U.S. withdrawal from the PA in June 2017, which became effective in November 2020. President Biden again accepted the PA, and the United States became a Party on February 19, 2021.U.S. climate change policy has involved actions implemented under various legal authorities. Prior to 2007, the federal government implemented voluntary programs to address climate change and regulatory programs that indirectly limited GHG emission increases from vehicles, appliances and equipment, and buildings. A shift toward direct regulation of GHG emissions occurred following the 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, in which the Supreme Court found that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has authority to regulate GHG emissions from motor vehicles as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. EPA subsequently issued rules to limit GHGs from various sources, although not all have been implemented. State and local governments have also taken a variety of actions, including emission controls on power plants and vehicles and building codes. U.S. LegislationMembers of Congress have historically expressed a range of perspectives regarding climate change issues. Legislative proposals have included carbon pricing frameworks (e.g., carbon taxes or cap-and-trade programs), sectoral approaches such as a clean energy standard, research funding or tax policies that support GHG-abating technology development and deployment, efforts to increase adaptation, and international cooperation. On the other hand, introduced resolutions have expressed that the multisector carbon pricing approaches are not in the economic interests of the United States. Votes on comprehensive climate change policy have been relatively rare in either chamber of Congress. Examples of enacted legislation involving climate change issues include tax incentives to promote renewable energy sources and carbon capture and sequestration efforts.Executive Branch Approach to Climate ChangePresident Biden announced a new GHG target for the United States: to reduce net GHG emissions by 50%-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. The Administration has also centralized executive branch organizations to identify and coordinate climate-related actions, and issued directives with a view toward decisions that support meeting the Administration’s GHG reduction targets. Issues for CongressCongress may consider issues concerning U.S. GHG targets, policy approaches, and funding. For example, U.S. participation in the PA raises issues that Congress may consider concerning the ambition, relative level of effort, and performance of other parties’ GHG mitigation, adaptation, technology, and financing associated with the PA. Differences in parties’ GHG policies may have implications for trade. For example, several national governments and the EU have discussed imposing border carbon adjustments (i.e., tariffs) on imported goods from countries that do not make similarly ambitious efforts to reduce GHG emissions.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R46947/R46947.3.pdf
IF11446,2021-05-11T04:00:00Z,2025-06-21T02:56:31Z,Weather and Climate Change: What’s the Difference?,"Weather is day-to-day temperature, precipitation, and other conditions.Climate is weather observed over multidecadal periods for a defined location. For example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) measures a climate normal over specific 30-year periods for locations in the United States.Climate variability is how weather may vary for multiple weeks or years from the long-term average. Climate change occurs when the long-term climate shifts, without an apparent return to previous normals.With much discussion of climate change in Congress, in the news, and among constituents, some commonly used words may be misunderstood or misused. Below are explanations of several key terms: weather, climate, climate variability, and climate change, as well as some associated concepts.Weather is the state of the atmosphere at a specific place and time, described by such conditions as temperature, precipitation, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. Weather can include conditions of the Earth’s water and land surfaces as well, with such variables as wave height and snow cover. Weather conditions can vary rapidly or last up to a few days in the mid-latitudes. NOAA compiles observations from weather stations around the United States, in the oceans, from international sources, and from other federal agencies. NOAA analyzes historical weather data and provides multiday forecasts or seasonal outlooks.Climate is defined by the long-term statistics of weather compiled for a specified place (Figure 1), including the globe. For example, climate would include the maximum hourly precipitation in July in a particular county over 30 years or the global mean surface temperature from 1900 to 2000. The availability of long-term data varies by location, making climate analysis for some locations challenging.NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information defines U.S. climate normals as “three-decade averages of climatological variables including temperature and precipitation” for defined locations. The most recent climate normal for a defined location uses weather observations for 1991-2020. People use climate normals for a wide array of purposes, such as placing daily weather into a historical context or determining technical specifications for the resilience of buildings and infrastructure against extreme weather.Figure 1. Illustration of How Weather Makes Up the Long-Term Climate, Using TemperatureDaily Maximum Temperature in Topeka, Kansas, the Past Climate Normal for 1981-2010 /Source: CRS, using data from NOAA, National Climate Data Center, Climate Data Online. Extracted February 26, 2020. Notes: The highest temperature on any given day and place is its daily maximum temperature, which is one aspect of weather. In this figure, each yellow dot represents the daily maximum temperature in Topeka, Kansas, per day in the most recent 30-year climate normal from 1981 to 2010. Overall, the statistics of this figure show aspects of Topeka’s recent climate. The darkest line, in the center, is the normal daily maximum temperature in NOAA’s climate normal. The smooth pink lines above and below it represent one (statistical) standard deviation from the average (about 18 percentage points above and below). The two yellows lines, above and below, represent the 5th and 95th percentiles, computed by CRS to show extreme daily maximum temperatures. (CRS used rolling three-day averages of these values to smooth the lines and better show instances of extreme weather—those dots above the 95th percentile or below the 5th.) About 90% of the time, the daily maximum temperature could be expected to fall between the 5th and 95th percentile lines. CRS selected Topeka because it is roughly in the center of the continental United States.Climate variability can include several different concepts. Generally, it means the differences from the long-term averages (or other statistics) of climate-related variables, such as precipitation, over longer time or wider areas than individual weather events. Climate variability may describe how a season is above or below the climate normal average for, say, temperature or snowfall. Climate variability may also describe longer, multiyear patterns that are not average, such as when certain large-scale weather patterns occur. An example is the so-called El Niño/La Niña (ENSO) cycle, with cycles of warm and cool periods in the Pacific Ocean and the atmosphere. ENSO phases typically last from nine to 12 months and on average occur every two to seven years. With only climate variability, scientists would expect the climate to reflect historically average conditions. When the climate continues to change over longer times, climatologists discern climate change. In effect, this means that what was “normal” has shifted. See Figure 2.Climate change may be discerned when the statistics of the climate (e.g., the climate normal) continue to shift over multiple decades. Distinguishing climate change from climate variability can be challenging. Detecting climate change requires multiple decades of consistently collected measurements. The greater the climate change relative to the variability, the more rapidly scientific detection can occur. Observers have pointed to this as one reason that scientists did not reach consensus until the 1990s that the Earth’s climate had changed over the 20th century. Global warming is one aspect of climate change; it is a sustained increase of global average temperature, usually measured at the surface of the Earth, though it may also be measured at specific altitudes in the atmosphere. Figure 2.Illustration of Climate Variability and Change in Global Mean Surface Temperatures, 1880-2019Anomalies (differences) from average 1901-2000 in oCelsius/Source: CRS, using data from NOAA, Climate at a Glance. Notes: The blue dots represent each year’s annual average temperature and, as a set, illustrate interannual variability of temperature. The yellow line shows climate variability as a rolling seven-year average of annual temperatures. The red line depicts climate change as increasing annual temperature, averaged over rolling 30-year periods.Attributing Climate Variability and Climate Change to Different “Forcings”A number of factors drive climate variability and climate change. Some factors are internal to the climate system, and some, such as solar variability or human-related greenhouse gas emissions, are external forcings. Each factor has its own rhythm and pattern, temporally ranging from less than a year to tens of thousands of years. Geographically, some forcings have stronger regional or hemispheric effect, while others are global. The temporal and geographical characteristics of each is like a fingerprint on the climate system. Using such “fingerprints,” with sufficient observations and powerful computing systems, the 2017 U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA4) concluded:It is extremely likely [>95%] that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.For more information about scientific assessments of climate change, see CRS Report R45086, Evolving Assessments of Human and Natural Contributions to Climate Change, by Jane A. Leggett.Extreme Weather and Climate ChangeSome extreme weather can lead to emergencies or disasters. Not all extreme weather events can be attributed to climate change. Nonetheless, climate models project that some events that would be extreme in the current climate—such as daily maximum temperatures higher than 92oF in July in Topeka (Figure 1)—would occur more and more frequently as the Earth’s climate warms with continued greenhouse gas emissions. Extremely cold days are expected to become less frequent with global warming.According to the 2017 NCA4, since the mid-20th century “[s]ome extremes have already become more frequent, intense, or of longer duration, and many extremes are expected to continue to increase or worsen.” As examples, “what in the past have been considered to be extreme precipitation events are becoming more frequent” on most continents, and “[t]he annual minimum and maximum sea ice extent have decreased over the last 35 years.” However, “[w]hether global trends in high-intensity tropical cyclones are already observable is a topic of active debate.” So while not all extreme weather experienced today can be attributed to climate change, climate change may make some of today’s extreme events more likely (especially those related to high temperatures, hydrological drought, or heavy precipitation). Scientists use complex attribution studies, such as “fingerprinting,” to draw such conclusions.Global Change Is Broader Than Climate ChangeAnother concept, broader than climate change, is that of global change. The Global Change Research Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-606) defined it as “changes in the global environment (including alterations in climate, land productivity, oceans or other water resources, atmospheric chemistry, and ecological systems) that may alter the capacity of the Earth to sustain life.”",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IF/PDF/IF11446/IF11446.4.pdf
IF11693,2020-12-03T05:00:00Z,2025-06-20T23:55:00Z,Agricultural Soils and Climate Change Mitigation,"Policymakers, scientists, farmers, and other stakeholders have debated the potential of agricultural soils to sequester (store) carbon and help mitigate future climate change. This discussion includes various approaches to agriculture—referred to as carbon farming, regenerative agriculture, farming for soil health, and farming for soil carbon sequestration—and their potential to increase agriculture’s role as a greenhouse gas (GHG) sink and reduce its role as a GHG source. GHG sinks remove and store GHGs from the atmosphere, and GHG sources emit (release) them. Figure 1. Carbon Cycling in Agricultural Soils/Source: Figure created by CRS.Agriculture: A GHG Source and SinkAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the agriculture sector is a net emitter of GHGs; agricultural practices, including crop and livestock operations, currently emit more GHGs than they remove. The EPA’s annual Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks reports estimates of anthropogenic GHG emissions and sinks in the United States, using internationally standardized sectors. On the source side, the agriculture sector’s GHG emissions—primarily methane and nitrous oxide—include those from livestock and soil management. The 2020 Inventory shows that in 2018, the agriculture sector contributed about 10% of total U.S. GHG emissions. The Inventory reports estimates of net emissions (emissions minus removals) from the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry sector (LULUCF)—primarily carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and carbon storage. LULUCF includes net emissions for forestlands, agricultural croplands, grasslands, and other land types. Data from 2018 and prior years indicate that U.S. croplands are a net GHG source and grasslands are a net sink. Land-use change, rather than land use, largely shapes these patterns—the conversion of other land-use types to croplands (net emissions) and to grasslands (net removals).Agricultural Practices That Store CarbonSoils store carbon in two basic forms: organic (derived from living material, such as plant roots) and inorganic (derived from nonliving material, such as minerals). Soil organic carbon (SOC) measures the carbon in soil organic matter (SOM), which consists largely of soil microbes (i.e., bacteria and fungi), and decaying and decayed plant and animal material. In addition to its role sequestering carbon, SOM is important to soil health and agricultural productivity. Photosynthesis, decomposition, and respiration are the major factors in determining SOC levels (Figure 1). Photosynthesis fixes atmospheric CO2 into plant material, which can lead to increased SOC. Decomposition of SOM releases CO2 into the atmosphere and leaves a small amount of carbon in the soil. Respiration of plants and microbes releases CO2 into the atmosphere as a by-product of using organic materials for energy and growth; this process returns to the atmosphere some of the carbon fixed through photosynthesis.Agricultural practices have generally increased net GHG emissions, but certain practices can reduce GHG emissions in the atmosphere and increase net carbon storage in soils. Such practices generally reduce soil exposure to air and increase plant root growth. These practices include no-till or reduced-till land management and use of cover crops, compost, and manure. The combination of multiple practices may further increase carbon storage in soils. The adoption of carbon-sequestering practices depends on factors that include requirements for equipment and labor and vary widely in the United States (Table 1).Table 1. Selected Carbon-Sequestering Management Practices in Use in U.S. Croplands (2017)Management PracticeAcres (millions)% of Total CroplandNo-Till (includes Rotational Till)10527%Reduced-Till9825%Cover Crops154%Source: USDA, 2017 Census of Agriculture (COA), 2019, Table 47.Note: Total U.S. cropland = 396 million acres (COA, Table 1). Scientific DebateThe carbon sequestration potential of agricultural soils has been an active research area for decades. Some scientists are optimistic and others advise caution when considering agriculture’s potential to measurably mitigate global GHG emissions.The utility and effectiveness of mitigating GHG emissions via agriculture depends in part on thecarbon-storage potential of agricultural soils, carbon-storing potential of agricultural practices, andcarbon storage over time.Carbon-storage potential of agricultural soils. Recent estimates suggest that over the past 12,000 years, human land use has resulted in a cumulative global loss of about 116 gigatons (GT) of SOC. Some researchers assert that today’s soils have the technical potential to achieve the amount of SOC that they held prior to these losses, and that today’s soils have the attainable potential to store some proportion of the lost amount. Scientists’ estimates of the attainable potential vary considerably.Differences between the technical and attainable potentials derive from many factors, including socioeconomic and policy constraints. As examples, farmers who rent rather than own their land may not have long-term economic incentives to implement soil management changes; farmers may not have the equipment needed to adopt new management practices; or existing agricultural policies may incentivize management decisions that align with goals other than carbon sequestration (e.g., maximizing production or reducing labor and other inputs).Carbon-storing potential of agricultural practices. A 2019 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine reviewed a variety of technologies aimed at reducing and eliminating GHG emissions and evaluated agricultural carbon sequestration as among the most cost-effective. It estimated that agricultural practices could sequester up to 0.25 GT of CO2 (0.07 GT of carbon) per year in the United States—equivalent to about 4% of total U.S. emissions from all sectors in 2018—for a cost of less than $20 per ton of CO2. The report’s estimate for agricultural carbon sequestration assumes full adoption of soil conservation practices.Carbon storage over time. Ongoing questions include how long sequestered carbon remains in the soil and how long management practices designed to store carbon continue to sequester carbon. Research shows that some practices store carbon only while they are in use. For example, carbon accumulated through no-till management is released when the field is tilled again. Research suggests that no-till management may increase net soil carbon sequestration for an estimated 20 years before plateauing and declining to near-zero in later decades.Selected Initiatives and Policy ProposalsExisting and proposed approaches in the U.S. private and public sectors, and internationally, may encourage climate change mitigation in agriculture. Some cite climate change mitigation as a goal, while others identify increased economic opportunities for the agriculture sector. Selected current examples are discussed below.Private sector. A number of private and nonprofit entities are attempting to use markets to create business incentives to reduce net CO2 emissions in agriculture. For example, IndigoAg, a U.S.-based private company, launched its Terraton Initiative in 2019. The initiative aims to remove 1 trillion tons of CO2 (~272 GT of carbon) from the atmosphere by bringing 12 billion acres of global farmland under regenerative agriculture practices (e.g., no-till, reduced synthetic fertilizers, and incorporating livestock into croplands). The initiative includes a domestic carbon market focused solely on agriculture. Carbon markets enable entities to buy or sell credits or offsets for GHG emissions reductions. Carbon markets may pay farmers for the reduced emissions resulting from the use of specific management practices or measures of soil carbon over time.Public sector. Some legislation introduced in the 116th Congress would support farmers that implement carbon-sequestering practices. For example, the Growing Climate Solutions Act of 2020 (S. 3894/H.R. 7393) would create a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) program to certify third parties as GHG technical assistance providers and verifiers of carbon sequestration protocols. Such a program might facilitate farmer and forest owner participation in carbon markets but would not create them.The Agriculture Resilience Act (H.R. 5861) would promote voluntary, incentive-based conservation measures. Among proposed actions, the bill would amend the USDA Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP, 16 U.S.C. §3839aa et seq.) to add reducing GHGs and sequestering carbon to existing program considerations.State-level initiatives also provide public sector opportunities to encourage GHG mitigation through agricultural soils. California’s mandatory emissions trading system and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative both allow agricultural offsets, though not for soil carbon. International. Most observers argue that addressing climate change will involve some degree of internationally coordinated efforts. Specific to soil carbon, France launched the 4 per 1000 Initiative in 2015, with the premise that increasing the carbon in global agricultural soils by four parts per thousand (~3.5 GT) per year would mitigate the annual increase of atmospheric CO2 due to human activity. The initiative invites its stakeholders (e.g., national governments, private companies) to declare or implement practical actions related to soil carbon storage. Some nonfederal U.S. entities (e.g., private companies, foundations) are members, but the U.S. government is not.Policy ChallengesMany initiatives to increase soil carbon sequestration through agriculture are predicated on accurately quantifying SOC. Scientists recognize this as a technical challenge, as such quantification needs to be extrapolated from remote sensing data or discrete sampling over space and time. Improving measurement accuracy may need additional research, innovation, investment, and technical assistance.If carbon-storing agricultural practices cost more than alternative practices (e.g., in terms of labor, equipment, productivity, or sale price), farmers are unlikely to adopt them absent requirements or incentives. Various incentives, such as those provided through carbon markets, may change the economic calculus.Lack of awareness among agricultural producers of carbon-storing agricultural practices—what they are, what costs and benefits they may provide, and how to implement them—may also impede adoption. USDA programs, such as the USDA Climate Hubs, cooperative extension, and Natural Resource Conservation Service technical assistance programs, may play a role in increasing awareness of these practices, as may other state and private efforts.(Note: This In Focus was originally authored by Genevieve K.

R46452,2020-07-15T04:00:00Z,2025-06-20T22:25:31Z,Surface Transportation Reauthorization and Climate Change: H.R. 2 and S. 2302,"Federal highway, public transportation, and intercity passenger rail programs are authorized through FY2020 under the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act (P.L. 114-94). During the 116th Congress, transportation bills including provisions related to climate change have moved forward in both the House and the Senate. In August 2019, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works reported the America’s Transportation Infrastructure Act of 2019 (ATIA; S. 2302), which would reauthorize the highway infrastructure elements of surface transportation programs from FY2021 through FY2025. In July 2020, the House of Representatives passed the Investing in a New Vision for the Environment and Surface Transportation (INVEST) in America Act as part of the larger Moving Forward Act (H.R. 2). The INVEST in America Act would provide an extension of existing highway, public transportation, and intercity passenger rail programs for one year (FY2021) and a subsequent four-year reauthorization of modified programs (FY2022-FY2025). S. 2302 and H.R. 2 include both mitigation policies and programs that aim to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from surface transportation and adaptation policies and programs that seek to make the surface transportation system more resilient and less vulnerable to the impacts of actual or expected future climate change.Recent changes in the earth’s climate and expected future changes are strongly related to the emission of GHGs from man-made sources. Transportation accounted for 28% of GHG emissions in the United States in 2018, the largest amount of any economic sector. These GHG emissions come mainly from highway travel, with passenger cars and light-duty trucks responsible for about 59% of the total, and heavy- and medium-duty trucks responsible for another 23%. GHG emissions from transportation peaked in 2005, but have risen over the past few years in part because of increased passenger travel and goods movement; emissions growth has been somewhat mitigated by improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency. Data are likely to show a continued increase of transportation emissions in 2019, but a drop in 2020 due to the disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.GHG emissions from surface transportation are largely a function of vehicle fuel efficiency, the carbon content of fuel used, and vehicle miles traveled (VMT). There are several current federal policies that address GHG emissions, but emissions reduction was not a primary goal when they were enacted. Moreover, many of these policies and programs are not typically addressed in surface transportation reauthorization legislation. For example, vehicle fuel efficiency standards were enacted mainly to address dependence on foreign oil and are typically undertaken in energy legislation.Both S. 2302 and H.R. 2 include funding and policy changes that address GHG emissions primarily from a transportation infrastructure perspective. For instance, both bills include new programs aimed at reducing carbon pollution by funding infrastructure projects that would reduce highway vehicle travel. In the Senate bill this program would be authorized at $700 million per year and in the House bill at almost $2.1 billion per year. Both bills also include new programs to fund alternative fueling infrastructure, $200 million per year in the Senate bill and $350 million per year in the House bill. H.R. 2 would also authorize major increases in funding for public transportation and intercity passenger rail programs. For public transportation funding, for example, H.R. 2 would increase the authorized amount from $12.2 billion per year in the FAST Act to $21.4 billion per year.Impacts from actual or expected future climate change are likely to include higher average temperatures, greater extremes of temperature, more precipitation overall with an increase in intensity and variation, and a rise in sea level. Existing surface transportation infrastructure may be vulnerable to a changing climate because it was constructed for sea level and weather extremes that are being or are likely to be exceeded in the future. Adaptation measures are actions taken to reduce the vulnerabilities and increase the resilience of the transportation system to these effects.Currently, there is no dedicated surface transportation funding for adaptation and resilience projects, although existing program funding in many cases can be used to assess the potential impacts of climate change and to apply adaptation strategies. Both S. 2302 and H.R. 2 would create a new highway program for resilience projects. The Senate bill would authorize about $1 billion per year and the House bill would authorize almost $1.6 billion per year. Both bills would also require greater consideration of climate change in transportation planning.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R46452/R46452.4.pdf
IN11545,2020-11-25T05:00:00Z,2025-06-20T23:11:05Z,How Do Bank Regulators Treat Climate Change Risks?,"IntroductionPotential risks to the financial system from climate change have attracted growing attention in government, academia, and media, raising questions about the roles of central banks and bank regulators in addressing such risks. The U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve (Fed), has responsibilities involving financial stability, monetary policy, and banking supervision. Climate change—defined in a November 9, 2020, Fed report as “the trend toward higher average global temperatures and accompanying environmental shifts such as rising sea levels and more severe weather events”—may impact each of these. This could occur either through physical risks, such as greater storms and wildfires, or through “transition risk,” meaning the risk that changed government policies or market perceptions might lead to sudden asset price drops, such as for carbon-emitting industries. The Fed report on financial stability warned that sudden hazards can bring about direct losses that could negatively impact banks’ investments. It asserted that even slowly developing hazards such as rising sea levels could lead to sudden price drops for bank investments if abrupt changes in public perceptions about such risks emerges. This Insight focuses on the central bank’s role in banking supervision and climate change risks and on what the Fed and other banking regulators have done to address such risks.Reliance on Existing Broad GuidanceFederal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell outlined in an April 2019 response to a congressional request that the Fed based its assessment of lending risks from climate-related events on a broader 1996 supervisory guidance and additional 1996 supervisory letter:[T]he Board issued supervisory guidance in 1996, to ensure that bank management takes into account all relevant risks in their underwriting and review practices. Our guidance with respect to credit underwriting and asset quality provides supervisors the flexibility necessary to address risks from severe weather events. In addition, our guidance also specifically addresses lending to sectors where assessments of these risks are critical for due diligence and underwriting.The 1996 guidance, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, sets out the safety and soundness standards regulators use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Its standards are general, giving flexibility to bank supervisors. For instance, the 1996 guidance with respect to asset quality requires banks to conduct periodic asset quality reviews to identify problem assets and to estimate inherent losses in those assets. The standards for credit underwriting require banks to “consider the nature of the markets in which loans will be made.” Broadly, these standards may encompass physical and transition risks for climate change as well, Powell’s letter suggests. Calls for Climate Risk Stress TestingNotwithstanding this 1996 guidance and its broad scope, some question whether climate-related risks should be more overtly addressed in banking supervision. For instance, a 2020 report by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on “Managing Climate Risks in the Financial Sector” recommended the adoption of climate risk stress testing for financial institutions. Currently, the Federal Reserve stress tests large bank holding companies to make sure they hold sufficient capital to operate under potentially adverse economic conditions and shocks. Such stress tests are conducted periodically through the Fed’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) program.  Also, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111-203 as amended by P.L. 115-174) and its implementation, banks with consolidated assets of over $250 billion must conduct their own annual stress testing, and those with $100 million to $250 billion in consolidated assets must undergo biannual stress testing. Although climate risk is not currently required in the CCAR stress testing program for most individual banks’ annual stress testing, a March 2020 speech on climate change and bank supervision by a New York Federal Reserve Bank official noted that a number of financial institutions have begun using “climate-related scenario analysis” of their own accord to model potential risks, such as those arising from severe weather events that might stress mortgage portfolios. In addition, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)—which oversees banks with assets totaling $2.6 trillion—announced on October 29, 2020, its requirements for climate risk stress testing. The NYDFS said all New York–regulated banking organizations must begin integrating financial risks from climate change into their governance frameworks, risk management, and business strategies. NYDFS said compliance should include an assessment of climate-change-related risk factors such as credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputational risk, and strategy risk. Internationally, a group of central banks called the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) has begun developing methodologies for conducting climate stress testing. At a November 10, 2020, Senate Banking Committee hearing, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Quarles reportedly noted that the Fed had sought membership in the NGFS group and expected to join by spring 2021. The European Central Bank in May 2020 released a supervisory guide to climate-related and environmental risks that calls on banks to develop climate-related stress scenarios and consider such risks when developing strategy and risk management plans. Climate stress testing could pose significant challenges that differ from the existing CCAR stress tests already conducted by the Fed. For instance, one banking industry white paper noted that while there is extensive historical data on the interactions between macroeconomic and financial variables, there is far less data on the interaction between climate events and financial variables. Also, climate stress testing would be aimed at measuring future effects that may not emerge in a linear fashion but may accelerate, adding further difficulty to modeling, it noted. While, in the United States, existing CCAR stress testing typically extends to nine fiscal quarters, the effects of climate change are estimated on longer time horizons—over multiple decades—adding to uncertainty. In addition, determining financial effects of climate change involves the extent to which government policies may change. This remains highly uncertain yet would likely have significant effects on any “transition risk.” Relative to traditional capital stress testing, climate stress testing appears more sensitive to modeling criteria and assumptions, which could create greater variance in outcomes.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IN/PDF/IN11545/IN11545.1.pdf
IF11103,2021-01-12T05:00:00Z,2025-06-20T22:39:54Z,A Brief Comparison of Two Climate Change Mitigation Approaches: Cap-and-Trade and Carbon Tax (or Fee),"Almost all climate scientists agree that greenhouse gas (GHG) emission increases have contributed to observed climate change and that continued increases in GHG emissions will contribute to future climate change. Although a variety of efforts seeking to reduce GHG emissions are currently underway on the international level and in individual states or regional partnerships, federal policymakers and stakeholders have different viewpoints over what to do—if anything—about GHG emissions, future climate change, and related impacts. For policymakers considering actions to reduce GHG emissions, various policy options are available. Over the last 15 years, many of the legislative proposals have involved market-based approaches, such as a GHG emissions cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax or emissions fee. These particular approaches may be considered in the 117th Congress and are discussed below. The information below provides an overview of two approaches while briefly addressing their similarities and differences. What Is a Cap-and-Trade System?A cap-and-trade system is a policy tool that creates a cap on GHG emissions from selected emission sources while providing the sources with flexibility—on-site reduction or emissions trading—when complying with the emissions cap. The cap could apply to the primary GHG emitted by human activity, carbon dioxide (CO2), or it could apply to multiple GHGs, such as methane, nitrous oxide, or fluorinated gases. Covered sources in prior legislative proposals have included major emitting sectors (such as power plants and specific industries), fuel producers and/or processors (such as coal mines or petroleum refineries), or some combination of both. An emissions cap is partitioned into emission allowances (or permits). Typically, in a GHG cap-and-trade system, an emission allowance represents the authority to emit one metric ton of CO2-equivalent—a measure that accounts for different GHG global warming potentials.Policymakers may decide to (1) sell the emission allowances through periodic auctions, which would generate a new federal revenue stream; (2) distribute allowances to covered sources at no cost (based on, for example, previous years’ emissions); or (3) use some combination of these strategies. Given that emission allowances have a market value, the distribution of emission allowances would likely be a source of significant debate during a cap-and-trade program’s development, as discussed below.At the end of each established compliance period (a calendar year or multiple years), covered sources submit emission allowances to an implementing agency to cover the number of tons emitted during the period. Generally, if a source did not provide enough allowances to cover its emissions, the source would be subject to penalties. Under an emissions cap, covered sources would have a financial incentive to make reductions beyond what is required, because they could (1) sell unused emission allowances to entities that face higher costs to reduce their facility emissions, (2) reduce the number of emission allowances they need to purchase, or (3) bank emission allowances—if allowed—to use in a future compliance period. A cap-and-trade system would create an emissions trading market. Depending on program design details, emission allowance trading could involve not only sources directly subject to an emissions cap but also a range of brokers and intermediaries. The federal government oversees existing emissions trading programs (sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) and would likely oversee a GHG program.What Is a Carbon Tax (Emissions Fee)?A carbon tax or emissions fee is a policy tool that provides a financial incentive to reduce GHG emissions by attaching a price to GHG emissions (CO2 emissions or multiple GHGs) or their emission inputs, namely fossil fuels. The choice of terminology between a tax or fee may have procedural consequences, particularly in terms of congressional committee jurisdiction, which could potentially influence the policy’s design. As many policymakers, stakeholders, and academic journals use the term carbon tax, this is the default term in this document. A central policy choice when establishing a price on GHG emissions is the rate of the carbon tax (measured in dollars per ton of emissions). Several factors could be considered when setting the rate. For example, Congress could set the rate at a level or pathway—based on modeling estimates—that would achieve a specific GHG emissions target. Congress may also consider whether the tax rate should increase over time and, if so, by how much.A carbon tax would generate a new revenue stream. The magnitude of the revenues would depend on the scope and rate of the tax, the responsiveness of covered entities in reducing their potential emissions, and multiple other market factors. A 2018 Congressional Budget Office study estimated that a $25/metric ton tax on energy-related and other GHG emissions would yield approximately $100 billion each year during the first 10 years of the program. The distribution of this new revenue stream would likely be a source of significant debate, as discussed below.Similarities Between ApproachesCap-and-trade and carbon tax instruments are market-based approaches that may be used to reduce GHG emissions. In many ways, a cap-and-trade program and carbon tax would produce similar effects. Both would place a market price on GHG emissions (directly or indirectly), and both would increase the relative market price of more carbon-intensive energy sources, particularly coal, which generate greater emissions per unit of energy. This result could lead to the displacement of these sources with lower carbon-intensive sources, including renewables; spur innovation in emission reduction technologies; and stimulate actions that may decrease emissions, such as efficiency improvements.Distribution of Allowance Value and Tax RevenueWhen designing either program, policymakers would likely face challenging decisions regarding the distribution of the new emission allowance value (which includes both auction revenues and distribution of no-cost allowances) or tax revenues. Policymakers could apply the allowance value or tax revenue to support a range of policy objectives but would encounter trade-offs among objectives. The central trade-offs include minimizing economy-wide costs (often measured in terms of gross domestic product); lessening the costs borne by specific groups, particularly low-income households and displaced workers or communities; and supporting a range of specific policy objectives, which may or may not be related to climate change.Economic ImpactsA primary concern with either approach regards their potential for economy-wide impacts and disproportionate effects on particular demographic groups and specific industries. The degree of these potential effects would depend on multiple factors, including the scope of the program and the use of allowance value or tax revenues. Policymakers may have different perspectives on whether estimated economy-wide costs—often measured in terms of U.S. gross domestic product—are significant. In addition, some would argue that these costs be compared with the climate benefits achieved from the program as well as the estimated costs of taking no action. Estimates of climate-related benefits and costs often contain considerable uncertainty and have generated debate in recent years. Either approach may yield disproportionate impacts on certain demographic groups, particularly lower-income households, which spend a greater proportion of their income on energy needs. Congress could address these impacts by distributing some of the allowance value or tax revenues back to households in some fashion.While some domestic industries may thrive, a price on GHG emissions could create a competitive disadvantage for other industries, particularly emission-intensive, trade-exposed industries. Policymakers could address some of the potential concerns, for example, by including a border adjustment mechanism and allocation of no-cost emission allowances or tax rebates to selected industries.Coverage DecisionsUnder either approach, policymakers would face a similar debate regarding scope and applicability. For example, questions such as which emission sources should be subject to the program or which GHG emissions to include would be raised with either approach. Policymakers may consider multiple factors when debating these issues, including environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, costs, measurement, available technology, and administrative concerns.Role of Emission OffsetsMany existing cap-and-trade programs allow for the use of emission offsets as a compliance option. In a carbon tax program, policymakers could allow for tax credits for offset-type projects. An offset is a measurable reduction, avoidance, or sequestration of GHG emissions from a source not covered by an emission reduction program. Economic analyses have found that offset treatment could have a substantial impact on overall program cost, because these projects can often reduce emissions at a lower cost than many typically covered sources. However, in existing cap-and-trade programs, offsets have generated some controversy and raised concerns, including the credibility of emission reductions from particular offset projects and environmental justice issues more generally.Price Control Versus Quantity ControlA primary difference between a cap-and-trade system and a carbon tax program is that the former provides emissions certainty, while the latter provides price certainty. In one sense, preference for a price (carbon tax) or a quantity limit (emissions cap) depends on one’s preference for uncertainty—either uncertain emissions or uncertain program costs. Policymakers can include multiple design elements, such as a price safety valve or auction reserve price, with a cap-and-trade program that may blur the distinction between price and quantity control. Similarly, a carbon tax program could include a mechanism by which policymakers could alter the tax rate if they determine that emission reductions are not proceeding at a desirable pace. Concluding ObservationsDiscussions of cap-and-trade and carbon tax approaches often center on their potential advantages in terms of emissions uncertainty and price uncertainty, respectively. The degree to which one approach has an advantage in a particular context, such as transparency or administration, would depend on the designs of the programs being assessed. In many cases, these differences may be addressed with specific design elements.Although recent attention has largely focused on market-based mechanisms, policymakers can address emissions with other policy tools, including performance-based regulations, which currently apply to motor vehicle emissions, or promotion of mitigation technologies, such as carbon capture and sequestration.

Its objective is “to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development.”Stabilizing GHG concentrations in the atmosphere requires that the balance of “gross” emissions of GHG minus the removals of GHG from the atmosphere reach “net zero.”Two principles agreed in the UNFCCC are that (1) Parties should act “on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities” and (2) developed country Parties should take the lead in combating climate change. The bifurcation of responsibilities among Parties into developed (Annex I) and developing countries has been a major point of contention. Annex I Parties, including the United States, had stronger obligations, such as more rigorous reporting and reviews. A subset listed in Annex II, including the United States, committed to provide agreed financial resources and technology transfers. The commitments are qualitative and collective, not binding on individual Parties.The first subsidiary agreement to the UNFCCC was the 1997 Kyoto Protocol (KP), which entered into force in 2005. The United States signed but did not ratify the KP and so is not a Party. The developed Parties agreed to reduce GHG emissions by 5% below their 1990 levels, with different targets for each Party.In 2009, a political declaration, the Copenhagen Accord, led to explicit pledges from many Parties to mitigate GHG, though they remained bifurcated as Annex I and non-Annex I (i.e., developing countries) by both the type of action and the frequency and format of the reporting requirements. In 2010, the Cancun agreements took note of a Copenhagen pledge by developed country Parties to jointly mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020. Funds provided “may come from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources.”The Paris Agreement (PA) is the second major subsidiary agreement under the UNFCCC. The PA defines a collective, long-term objective to hold the GHG-induced increase in temperature to well below 2o Celsius (C) and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5o C above the pre-industrial level. In the PA, for the first time under the UNFCCC, all Parties participate in a common framework with common guidance, though some Parties are allowed limited flexibility.The negotiators intended the PA to be legally binding on its Parties, though not all provisions are mandatory. All Parties must submit “Nationally Determined Contributions” (NDCs) containing nonbinding pledges to mitigate GHG emissions. The Parties are to update or submit new NDCs by 2020 and every five years thereafter. Each successive NDC of a Party “will represent a progression” and “reflect its highest possible ambition, reflecting its common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances.”The PA reiterates the obligation in the UNFCCC for developed country Parties to seek to mobilize financial support to assist developing country Parties with climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts, encouraging all Parties to provide financial support voluntarily. The decision to carry out the PA calls for continuing the Cancun collective mobilization through 2025. The Parties agree to set, prior to their 2025 meeting, a new collective, quantified goal of not less than $100 billion annually to assist developing country Parties. President Trump announced his intention in 2017 to withdraw the United States from the PA as soon as it was eligible. The U.S. Department of State notified the United Nations of U.S. withdrawal on November 4, 2019. The withdrawal takes effect on November 4, 2020, unless the U.S. government postpones or rescinds the withdrawal. A Party may reenter the PA 30 days after depositing notice that it has ratified, accepted, or acceded to the PA.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R46204/R46204.2.pdf
IF11746,2021-02-25T05:00:00Z,2025-06-21T02:56:28Z,United States Rejoins the Paris Agreement on Climate Change: Options for Congress,"On January 20, 2021, President Joe Biden accepted, on behalf of the United States, the Paris Agreement (PA), an international accord to address climate change for decades to come. The acceptance took effect on February 19, 2021—77 days after the United States’ withdrawal took effect under the Trump Administration. The withdrawal took effect exactly four years after the United States first became a Party to the PA under the Obama Administration. Congress may consider implications of U.S. participation in the PA along several dimensions, including foreign policy, economic, environmental, and legal. Although the President holds constitutional authority for U.S. foreign policy, the Senate may provide advice and consent, should the President submit the PA to be a treaty under U.S. law. Congress, by virtue of its own constitutional authorities, has options for shaping, funding, and conducting oversight of strategies—international and domestic—associated with U.S. PA commitments. Congress may seek to consult with the Administration on climate change and foreign policy, among other objectives. What Is the Paris Agreement?The PA exists under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The United States ratified the UNFCCC in 1992 with the advice and consent of the Senate. In 2016, the United States accepted the PA without requesting the Senate’s advice and consent; the Department of State took the view that the PA was an executive agreement containing no substantive, legal obligations for the United States beyond those already required by the UNFCCC. Under President Trump, the United States withdrew from the PA, citing concerns about fairness, costs of participating, and sovereignty. U.S. private sector and bipartisan support subsequently has grown for the PA, though there is not consensus on targets or policies to meet them.Under the UNFCCC, the United States and industrialized Parties listed in “Annex I” took on specific commitments for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, financial resources, reporting, and review. The PA does not contain the bifurcation of commitments in the UNFCCC between Annex I and developing country Parties. It established a single, common set of obligations for all Parties (with flexibilities for the least capable). For example, China agreed in the PA to the same binding requirements as the United States. A key requirement of the PA is that all Parties communicate “Nationally Determined Contributions” (NDC) every five years, though the content of an NDC is not binding. Once a Party, the United States must submit a new NDC; President Biden aims to do this before Earth Day 2021 (April 22).   A Party’s NDC must identify how the Party intends to abate its GHG emissions, with a current time horizon of 2030. (See text box.) Each Party decides its own pledge. All PA emissions targets are voluntary and nonbinding, although the PA contains provisions to encourage their achievement. The UNFCCC requires reporting and review of GHG emissions sources and sinks and other information, differentiated by types of Parties. The PA led to an enhanced transparency framework applicable to all Parties. The PA contains cooperative compliance mechanisms but not formal sanctions. GHG Pledges in Selected NDCs(with date of most recent NDC GHG target)United States (2015, prior to withdrawal): Reduce GHG emissions to 26%-28% below 2005 levels in 2025.China (2015): Inter alia, by 2030, to peak its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions; lower its CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by 60%-65% below 2005 levels; and increase the non-fossil-fuel share of energy consumption to around 20%.European Union (2020): A binding net domestic GHG emission reduction of at least 55% by 2030 compared with 1990.India (2016): Inter alia, reduce GHG emissions per unit of GDP by 33%-35% by 2030 from the 2005 level and reach 40% of its cumulative installed electric capacity from non-fossil-fuel sources by 2030. Mexico (2020): Inter alia, reduce GHG emissions by 22% and black carbon emissions by 51% by 2030 below a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario or reduce GHG emissions up to 36% and black carbon emissions up to 70% by 2030 below BAU by 2030, conditioned on financial, technical, and other support.Countries have long negotiated over what would constitute a “fair” distribution of effort under the UNFCCC. The strength of one Party’s GHG target compared with those of other countries can be viewed from various perspectives of fairness and level of effort. To illustrate, under existing NDCs, China’s GHG emissions could grow to 2030, whereas the European Union’s (EU’s) GHG emissions would fall. Nonetheless, China’s GHG emissions per person would remain well below those of the United States. China’s pledge would reduce its emissions per unit of GDP more than the United States would under its 2015 pledge. Foreign Policy and DiplomacyU.S. forceful negotiation, acceptance, withdrawal, and rejoining of the PA leaves legacies that are likely to shape future diplomacy. Some observers argue variously that the previous Administration’s withdrawal from the PA (1) reduced U.S. standing in the world by making the United States an international outlier on climate change; (2) strengthened perceptions that the United States was withdrawing from its traditional position of leadership in support of a rules-based international order; (3) created space for China to increase its world leadership on climate change and influence in international organizations and processes; and (4) made the United States appear less reliable as a negotiating partner. Some observers argue that any adverse implications of withdrawal were offset by benefits they perceive in avoided domestic costs, increased energy independence, dominance in global fossil fuel markets, and U.S. sovereignty.As the United States rejoins the PA, it may benefit from the goodwill of those in the international community who welcome the policy change. President Biden plans to host a Climate Leaders Summit on Earth Day 2021 to promote greater GHG reduction pledges before the next Conference of the Parties in early November 2021. He also is pursuing a host of further diplomatic and security initiatives. Observers suggest U.S. withdrawal left a legacy that may challenge the United States to regain the confidence of others and credibility for its commitments. Various commenters indicate the Biden Administration may need to significantly increase U.S. ambition to reduce net GHG emissions; embody steps necessary to achieve U.S. GHG targets in durable regulations and new law; demonstrate performance in accord with its strategy; and be consistent in fulfilling unmet commitments on reporting and financing. Environmental ConsiderationsThe PA contains a collective commitment to achieve approximately net zero GHG emissions in the second half of this century. The President has called for “net-zero global emissions by mid-century or before.” The purpose in the PA is to hold the GHG-induced increase in global average temperature to well below 2o Celsius and to try to limit it to 1.5oC. The pledges made in NDCs to 2030 are intended as near-term steps in a multi-decadal process to avoid adverse impacts on people, economies, and the environmental systems on which societies depend. Many actions to reduce GHG emissions bring co-benefits—positive effects beyond the intended climate change benefits. An example is reduced health care costs and mortality associated with air pollution. In many instances, adopted GHG policies have been estimated to achieve co-benefits that themselves exceed the costs of the GHG reductions, without counting direct climate change benefits. The degree of co-benefits depends on policy design and depth of GHG reductions, as well as on the affected sectors. Economy and Trade ImplicationsParties intended the PA to lay a path to long-term transition of the world’s economies toward “deep decarbonization”—sustaining economic growth while delinking it from emissions of CO2 and other GHGs. Such a transition is generally expected to impose near- to medium-term costs, with the magnitude and distribution (e.g., across sectors or populations) depending on policy timing and design as well as private investment. Some economists estimate the costs of deep decarbonization would be less than the costs climate change would impose on people—costs of adapting to climate change plus residual losses where anticipatory action does not fully avoid adverse impacts. Trade could be affected by differences in Parties’ policies. China, South Korea, and European and other countries pursue investment toward low-GHG-emitting technologies in advanced energy, materials, electronics, vehicles, and others they expect to provide future trade advantages. Several governments and the EU have discussed imposing border adjustments (i.e., tariffs) on producers that do not make similarly ambitious efforts to reduce GHG emissions. Financial Assistance In the UNFCCC, higher-income Parties committed to provide financial assistance to lower-income Parties to help them meet their obligations and GHG targets. The decision accompanying the PA to implement it extends to 2025 a nonlegal goal from the 2009 Copenhagen Accord to mobilize jointly $100 billion per year to address the climate finance needs of developing countries. The funds “may come from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources.” The U.S. federal government has not provided public funds since FY2016 appropriations, though private sources have contributed billions to climate-related finance. President Biden has charged the Secretaries of State and the Treasury to lead development of a climate finance plan.Potential Options for CongressU.S. participation in the PA raises a number of options that Congress may consider, includingconsultation with the Department of State and/or the White House regarding new U.S. pledges under the UNFCCC and PA, and fulfilling currently unmet commitments on reporting and finance;oversight of Administration uses of existing statutory authorities to meet U.S. pledges, and whether there may be benefits in a more comprehensive legislated strategy, to address efficiency and distributional impacts;provision of public funds, or incentives for private financing, to assist low-income countries or particularly impacted populations; and/orrequests for assessments from the Administration of the ambitions, relative levels of effort, and performance of other Parties’ GHG mitigation, adaptation, technology, and financing associated with the PA.

LSB10605,2021-06-04T04:00:00Z,2025-06-21T02:54:29Z,Supreme Court Ruling May Affect the Fate of Climate Change Liability Suits,"On May 17, 2021, the Supreme Court issued a ruling that could delay climate liability suits—that is, lawsuits seeking damages for alleged climate change-related injuries that result from selling and producing fossil fuel products. In BP p.l.c. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, the Court considered the scope of judicial review of orders that transfer a lawsuit from federal to state court. The Court expanded the scope of appellate review of orders remanding climate liability cases to state court, a holding that will likely postpone judicial review of the merits of these suits.Legal challenges over the appropriate court venue may affect the law and precedent that is applied in more than 20 climate liability suits filed by state and local governments against fossil fuel producers in state courts. This Legal Sidebar reviews the background of the Baltimore case, the Supreme Court’s ruling, its potential effect on climate liability suits, and considerations for Congress.Removal from State to Federal CourtThe Baltimore case arose from lower court decisions related to whether climate liability suits belong in state or federal court. Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution limits federal courts’ jurisdiction to cases involving federal statutes, the Constitution, or treaties. A defendant may remove (transfer) a suit brought in state court to a federal district court if it falls with the federal court’s jurisdiction. If the plaintiff appeals the defendant’s removal action, a federal court can remand the case to state court if it concludes that the suit was improperly removed. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d), such remand orders are not subject to appellate review.Congress established two exceptions to the Section 1447(d) bar on appellate review of remand orders. In 1964, Congress permitted appellate review of remand orders if the state case was removed to federal court under the civil rights removal statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1443, which permits removal to federal court of suits in which “equal civil rights of citizens” cannot be enforced in state court. In 2011, Congress extended the exception to allow appellate review of removal orders under the federal officer removal statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1442, which authorizes the removal of state cases to federal court against any officer or agency of the United States for any act related to federal authority. It is this removal statute that provided a mechanism for the Supreme Court to review the Baltimore case. BP p.l.c. v. Mayor and City Council of BaltimoreIn July of 2018, the Mayor and City of Baltimore (Baltimore) filed suit in Maryland state court against 26 fossil fuel producers, alleging that they violated state nuisance, negligence, strict liability, and consumer fraud laws by producing, promoting, and marketing fossil fuel products that contribute to climate change. Baltimore claims that it suffered various “climate change-related injuries” as a result of these companies’ actions. The alleged injuries include infrastructure repair and planning and response costs associated with increases in sea levels, storms, floods, heatwaves, droughts, and extreme precipitation. Baltimore seeks compensatory damages, civil penalties, punitive damages, and other relief. Two of the defendants removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, asserting eight separate grounds to support removal. One of those eight grounds was that removal is authorized under the federal officer removal statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1442, because certain defendants entered into agreements and leases with the federal government to undertake some fuel production activities. The defendants also argued that the case should be removed because Baltimore’s claims are governed by federal common law and preempted by the Clean Air Act (CAA), other federal statutes, and the Constitution. Baltimore then moved to return the case to state court, asserting that the federal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the state-law claims. The Maryland federal district court granted the remand to state court, rejecting all eight removal grounds asserted by the defendants. The defendants appealed the federal district court’s remand order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The defendants cited the federal-officer exception to appellate review in 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d) as the basis for appellate jurisdiction, but they asked the Fourth Circuit to review the entire remand order. On appeal, the Fourth Circuit concluded that under 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d), it could review only the lower court’s ruling pursuant to the federal-officer removal statute and none of the other grounds for removal. Section 1447(d) states that:An order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1442 or 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by appeal . . . .The Fourth Circuit interpreted Section 1447(d) as limiting its appellate jurisdiction to grounds for removal under (1) the federal-officer removal statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1442, or (2) the civil-rights removal statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1443. (In other climate liability suits, the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the First, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits interpreted Section 1447(d) similarly in their review of remand orders.) The Fourth Circuit therefore affirmed the district court’s removal order, agreeing that contractual relationships between the defendants and federal agencies did not support removal based on the federal-officer removal statute. The Supreme Court granted the fossil fuel producers’ petition for a writ of certiorari on whether 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d) permits appellate review of any removal grounds addressed in a district court’s remand order where removal to federal court was based in part on the federal-officer or civil-rights removal statutes.Supreme Court RulingIn a 7-1 decision, the majority of the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Circuit erred, and that the Fourth Circuit had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d) to consider all of the defendants’ grounds for removal. (Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.) In an opinion authored by Justice Gorsuch, the majority reasoned that the ordinary meaning of “order remanding a case” in Section 1447(d) permits appellate review of all grounds for removal addressed in the district court’s remand order, even if the federal-officer or civil-rights removal statutes were not the defendants’ only grounds for removal. Justice Gorsuch highlighted the Court’s decision in Yamaha Motor Corp. USA v. Calhoun to support the majority’s interpretation of Section 1447(d). In Yamaha, the Court held that an appellate court has jurisdiction over any issue included in an order certified for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), and is not limited to the question of law the district court certified for further review. Because a removal order can be appealed under Section 1447(d), like an order certified for interlocutory appeal under Section 1292(b), the majority reasoned that an appeals court can review any ground for removal included within the order.The majority rejected Baltimore’s argument that expanding appellate review of removal orders would delay litigation of the merits of a case. The majority noted that Congress accepted the potential delay when it allowed appeal of removal orders in cases removed under the federal-officer and the civil-rights removal statutes. The Court declined to consider the merits of the other grounds for removal that the fossil fuel producers had raised, vacating the Fourth Circuit’s decision and remanding the case so that the Fourth Circuit could consider them for the first time.In her dissent, Justice Sotomayor argued that Section 1447(d) “does not speak clearly” to how the provision applies to cases removed on multiple grounds that include federal-officer or civil-rights removal. In reviewing possible interpretations of Section 1447(d), she reasoned that the majority’s interpretation stretches the exceptions to the bar on appellate review of removal orders “too far,” allowing defendants to “bootstrap” their removal arguments for appellate review “by tacking on an argument under §1442 or §1443.” She argued that restricting appellate review to the federal-officer or civil-rights removal statute grounds “best accords” with “Congress’s longstanding policy of not permitting interruption of the litigation of the merits of a removed case’ with lengthy jurisdictional disputes.” She asserted that the majority’s interpretation “opens a back door to appellate review that would otherwise be closed to” the defendants, further delaying litigation on the merits.Effect on Climate Liability SuitsBaltimore’s lawsuit is one of more than 20 similar suits that state and local governments have filed since 2017, seeking to hold fossil fuel producers liable for climate change-related damages under state nuisance, negligence, or consumer fraud laws. Many of these suits face similar issues related to court venue and challenges to the scope of appellate review of removal orders under Section 1447(d). As a result of the Supreme Court’s Baltimore ruling, four appellate courts will review all grounds seeking to remove climate suits to state courts in those pending cases. In addition to the remand to the Fourth Circuit in the Baltimore suit, the Supreme Court granted petitions that raised the same Section 1447(d) issue in climate liability suits filed by the state of Rhode Island, several cities and counties in California, and the Board of County Commissioners of Boulder County in Colorado. The Court cited its Baltimore ruling in vacating decisions from the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the First, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits, respectively, and remanded the cases to expand review to all grounds for removal to federal court, further delaying litigation of the merits of these suits. These federal courts of appeals will address, among other grounds, whether the suits should be removed to federal court because the state claims raise federal questions or are preempted by the CAA. If not for the Supreme Court’s decision in Baltimore, the state courts would have proceeded to adjudicate the merits of these cases to decide whether federal questions (including preemption) are viable defenses to the liability claims.Fossil fuel producers have sought to remove the state climate liability cases to federal court, where previous attempts to hold major sources of GHG emissions liable for climate change-related injuries have failed. In 2011, the Supreme Court held in American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut (AEP) that the CAA displaced the federal common law interstate nuisance claim seeking an injunction limiting GHG emissions from power plants. The Court explained that a federal statute displaces federal common law if the statute “speak[s] directly to [the] question’ at issue.” In 2012, the Ninth Circuit held in Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp. that the Supreme Court’s reasoning in AEP also precludes federal common law claims seeking monetary damages, rather than injunctive relief. Federal district courts have also dismissed other federal common law nuisance suits seeking climate change-related damages because the courts found that the claims were displaced by the CAA or raised nonjusticiable questions that only the political branches can resolve.Two federal appellate decisions have exercised jurisdiction to consider the kinds of removal arguments that, after Baltimore, are now more broadly subject to appellate review. In May 2020, the Ninth Circuit addressed these removal grounds in an appeal by the cities of Oakland and San Francisco. The federal district court in that case had denied a remand to state court, an order that is not subject Section 1447(d), and had dismissed the cities’ climate liability suit. In City of Oakland v. BP, the Ninth Circuit reversed the dismissal and ordered the district court to reconsider whether a remand to state court was warranted. The Ninth Circuit held that the federal district court did not have jurisdiction over the state-law public nuisance claim because it did not require resolution of a substantial question of federal law. The court also rejected the fossil fuel producers’ argument that the state-law nuisance claim raised federal questions because the claim is completely preempted by the CAA. The court explained that “the statutory language does not indicate that Congress intended to preempt every state law cause of action within the scope’ of the Clean Air Act” and that the CAA does not include a “substitute” federal claim for “nuisance caused by global warming.” The Ninth Circuit ordered the state-law nuisance claims to proceed in state court unless the lower court found an alternative basis for federal jurisdiction over the climate liability claims. Although federal preemption was an insufficient basis for federal court jurisdiction, the court noted that federal preemption can still be raised as a defense against the claims in state court. Even if the Ninth Circuit’s decision results in a remand of the cities’ claims to state court, the appeal of the district court’s remand order took approximately 21 months from filing to decision—highlighting the concern that the Supreme Court’s Baltimore decision will cause delays in adjudicating state-law climate liability claims. An April 2021 decision in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit illustrates how the merits of climate liability suits might fare in federal courts. In City of New York v. Chevron Corp., the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of New York City’s lawsuit seeking climate change damages from fossil fuel producers under state nuisance laws. Unlike the Oakland case in the Ninth Circuit, the City filed its suit in federal district court and did not involve court venue issues present in the Oakland and Baltimore cases. The Second Circuit held that federal common law displaced the City’s state-law claims against fossil fuel producers because applying New York law would conflict with federal interests in creating a uniform federal policy on regulating GHG emissions nationally. The court reasoned that a substantial damage award under state law would regulate cross-border GHG emissions indirectly by compelling fossil fuel producers to change or cease their production of fossil fuels. The Second Circuit then concluded that the CAA displaced the City’s federal common law claims for injunctions and damages, citing the rulings in AEP and Native Village of Kivalina. Rejecting the City’s argument that those rulings should not apply, the court determined that the substance of the City’s claim regarding the production and sale of fossil fuels was essentially the same as claims against GHG emitters because the injuries allegedly resulted from GHG emissions.Considerations for CongressStakeholders across the globe are turning increasingly to the judicial system to force governments, GHG emitters, and fossil fuel producers to take action on climate change or to take responsibility for actions contributing to climate change. For example, on May 26, 2021, a Dutch district court held that Royal Dutch Shell PLC violated the standard of care under Dutch law and ordered the company to reduce its GHG emissions by 45 percent by 2030, relative to 2019, including emissions from its own operations and from end-users of its products. This decision follows judicial rulings this year in Germany and France that held that their national governments failed to take sufficient action to address climate change.In the United States, Baltimore and other climate liability suits represent part of domestic efforts to address climate changes and its effects. In the United States, the Biden Administration, among other initiatives, set new goals to reduce GHG emissions by 50-52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 as part of rejoining the Paris Agreement. Meanwhile, Congress continues to debate varying legislative proposals to balance economic and environmental interests across industrial sectors and geographic regions.Without legislative clarification or direction on climate change concerns, state and local governments will continue to seek relief for climate-change related injuries through the courts. As a result, the courts will play a large role in defining the scope of appellate review, the appropriate venue for climate liability suits, and the applicability of federal versus state law. The Supreme Court is considering petitions to review the Ninth Circuit’s decision in City of Oakland v. BP to remand to state court. Congress could consider legislation that specifies which state law claims are removable to federal court or clarify when federal law would preempt the kinds of state law claims at issue in the climate liability suits. As an alternative to litigation, Congress could devise a legislative scheme to provide financial assistance to state and local governments to prevent or address injuries related to climate change impacts.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/LSB/PDF/LSB10605/LSB10605.1.pdf
R42405,2020-02-26T05:00:00Z,2025-06-21T00:50:53Z,European Energy Security: Options for EU Natural Gas Diversification,"As a major energy consuming region, Europe faces a number of challenges in addressing its future energy needs. For member states of the European Union (EU), challenges include rapidly rising global demand and competition for energy resources from countries such as China and India, tensions with Russia, efforts to integrate the EU’s internal energy market, and a growing need to shift fuels in keeping with the EU’s climate change policy goals. As a result, energy supply security has become a key concern for the EU. European energy security is also of significant interest to the United States.While energy policy in the EU has long been a strongly guarded competence of national governments, the EU’s role in energy policy has expanded over the last few decades. An important element of the EU’s energy supply strategy has been to shift to a greater use of natural gas and renewables and to move away from nuclear and coal. Russia is the most important of the EU’s natural gas suppliers, holding the top spot since 2014. The EU’s natural gas consumption is projected to grow as EU member states’ natural gas production continues to decline. If trends continue as projected, dependence on Russia as a supplier is likely to grow. Although some countries in the EU are exploring alternative sources for their natural gas needs, it is uncertain whether the EU as a whole can, or is willing to, replace a significant level of imports from Russia. Some EU member states that feel vulnerable to Russian energy supply manipulation are working hard to achieve supply diversification and energy sector integration.Meanwhile, Russia has sought to protect its share of the EU natural gas market. It has attempted to stymie European-backed alternatives by proposing competing pipeline projects and attempting to increase its influence with European companies by offering them stakes in these and other projects.Successive U.S. Administrations and Congresses have viewed European energy security as a U.S. national interest. In recent years, promoting diversification of EU natural gas supplies has been a focal point of U.S. energy policy in Europe and Eurasia. The Trump Administration has opposed new Russian gas projects as tools to maintain EU dependence on Russia. At the end of 2019, Congress passed the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-92), which included sanctions related to the construction of the Nord Stream 2 and TurkStream pipelines. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-94) includes the European Energy Security and Diversification Act of 2019, which seeks to promote the diversification of Central and East European energy sources and supply routes. Although the United States and the EU have sought to promote the export of piped natural gas from the Caspian Region and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States, this is not being achieved in volumes sufficient to counter Russian exports. Regions such as North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean have potential as alternative suppliers but are constrained in their ability to increase exports.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R42405/R42405.26.pdf
R45745,2020-04-27T04:00:00Z,2025-06-21T00:52:17Z,Transatlantic Relations: U.S. Interests and Key Issues,"For the past 70 years, the United States has been instrumental in leading and promoting a strong U.S.-European partnership. Often termed the transatlantic relationship, this partnership has been grounded in the U.S.-led post-World War II order based on alliances with like-minded democratic countries and a shared U.S.-European commitment to free markets and an open international trading system. Transatlantic relations encompass the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union (EU), close U.S. bilateral ties with most countries in Western and Central Europe, and a massive, interdependent trade and investment partnership. Despite periodic U.S.-European tensions, successive U.S. Administrations and many Members of Congress have supported the broad transatlantic relationship, viewing it as enhancing U.S. security and stability and magnifying U.S. global influence and financial clout.Transatlantic Relations and the Trump AdministrationThe transatlantic relationship currently faces significant challenges. President Trump and some members of his Administration have questioned NATO’s strategic value, and they have expressed considerable skepticism about the EU and the multilateral trading system. President Trump repeatedly voices concern that the United States bears an undue share of the transatlantic security burden and that EU trade policies are unfair to U.S. workers and businesses. The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU (“Brexit”) on January 31, 2020, could have implications for U.S. security and economic interests in Europe. U.S.-European divisions have emerged on regional and global issues, from aspects of relations with Russia and China to policies on Iran, Syria, arms control, and climate change. Managing the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has further strained relations.The Trump Administration asserts that its policies toward Europe seek to ensure that European allies and partners are equipped to work with the United States in confronting the challenges posed by an increasingly competitive world. U.S. officials maintain that the U.S. commitment to NATO and European security remains steadfast; the Trump Administration has backed new NATO initiatives to deter Russian aggression, supported the accession of two new members to the alliance, and increased U.S. troop deployments in Europe. The Administration also contends that it is committed to working with the EU, as signaled by its intention to pursue a U.S.-EU trade liberalization agreement. Supporters credit President Trump’s approach toward Europe with strengthening NATO and compelling the EU to address U.S. trade concerns.Critics argue that the Administration’s policies are endangering decades of U.S.-European consultation and cooperation that have advanced key U.S. geostrategic and economic interests. Some analysts suggest that current U.S.-European divisions are detrimental to transatlantic cohesion and represent a win for potential adversaries such as Russia and China. Many European leaders worry about potential U.S. global disengagement, and some increasingly argue that Europe must be better prepared to address both regional and international challenges on its own.Congressional InterestsThe implications of Trump Administration policies toward Europe and the extent to which the transatlantic relationship contributes to promoting U.S. security and prosperity may be of interest to the 116th Congress. Broad bipartisan support exists in Congress for NATO, and many Members of Congress view the EU as an important U.S. partner, especially given extensive U.S.-EU trade and investment ties. At the same time, some Members have long advocated for greater European burdensharing in NATO, or may oppose European or EU policies on certain foreign policy or trade issues. Areas for potential congressional oversight include the future U.S. role in NATO, as well as prospects for U.S.-European cooperation on challenges such as managing a resurgent Russia and an increasingly competitive China. Based on its constitutional role over tariffs and foreign commerce, Congress has a direct interest in monitoring proposed new U.S.-EU trade agreement negotiations. In addition, Congress may consider how the Administration’s trade and tariff policies could affect the U.S.-EU economic relationship.

R46323,2020-04-22T04:00:00Z,2025-06-21T02:02:13Z,Reauthorization of Federal Highway Programs,"Federal highway construction and safety programs are currently authorized through September 30, 2020, under the five-year Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act; P.L. 114-94). For the 1,027,849-mile system of federal-aid highways, the FAST Act provided an average of $45 billion annually. Although there are exceptions, federally funded projects are generally limited to this system that includes roughly 25% of all U.S. public road mileage. Of these funds, nearly 93% are distributed to the states via formula. The states have nearly complete control over the use of these funds, within the limits of federal planning, eligibility, and oversight rules. Money is not provided up front. A state is reimbursed after work is started, costs are incurred, and the state submits a voucher to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The highway program focuses on highway construction and planning, and does not support operations or routine maintenance. The federal share of project costs is generally 80%, but 90% for Interstate System projects.Nearly all highway funding comes from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). The excise taxes on gasoline and diesel, which are the main support of the HTF, are fixed in terms of cents per gallon (18.3 cents for gasoline and 24.3 cents for diesel), and do not adjust for inflation or change with fuel prices. The rates were last raised in 1993. These taxes no longer raise enough money to support the programs Congress has authorized. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections estimate that the HTF shortfall for a five-year reauthorization bill, FY2021-FY2025, will be $68.8 billion, of which the highway portion will be $46.5 billion. The funding shortfall is a major issue framing the reauthorization debate. The FAST Act transferred $70 billion in general Treasury funds to the HTF, $51.9 billion of which were for highways. Congress could deal with the shortfall that is projected to persist over the coming years in three ways: again transfer money from the Treasury general fund; cut spending by roughly 25%; and raise revenue dedicated to the HTF. Widely discussed revenue options include increasing the rates of existing gasoline, diesel, and truck taxes or imposing new charges such as a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) charge.Other issues likely to be considered by Congress include the following:Whether any additional federal spending for highways should be distributed by formula, giving the states greater control, or through discretionary programs that distribute funds based on Administration or congressional priorities.Whether to retain the current highway funding formula, which links states’ annual apportionments to their funding shares in past years, or to introduce such formula factors as each state’s lane miles, population growth, or VMT.Whether to create stand-alone programs to address issues such as bridge conditions or climate change mitigation and adaptation.Whether the stand-alone National Highway Freight Program, a formula program that has been highly popular with the states, should be funded at a higher level relative to the other formula programs. Whether the Emergency Relief program should be expanded to cover a wider range of resilience needs.Whether states should be permitted to place tolls on free Interstate Highway lanes, and whether to regulate the use of tolls.The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW) reported the America’s Transportation Infrastructure Act of 2019 (ATIA; S. 2302) on August 1, 2019. The bill includes the highway elements of surface transportation reauthorization under EPW’s jurisdiction. It is the only active FAST Act reauthorization bill to date.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R46323/R46323.1.pdf

The United States provides foreign assistance in the form of financial, programmatic, and technical support to address international conservation activities. International conservation activities include those relating to species protection, habitat restoration, and forest recovery, among other priorities. Several federal agencies administer these programs, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Department of State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Many Members of Congress have demonstrated interest in international conservation, particularly with respect to biodiversity issues, conservation funding, and congressional oversight. In particular, some Members maintain an active interest in international conservation treaties to which the United States is a signatory, such as the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Recently, concerns over conservation efforts have escalated in the wake of a report asserting a significant loss in biodiversity due to human interactions with natural resources.Table 1 provides a list of selected U.S. international programs that address biodiversity and conservation. It includes a description of each program, as well as the enacted funding levels for FY2018-FY2020. The funding in Table 1 is for specific programs, for financial commitments to international treaties or organizations, or from a line item in appropriations law or a committee report that identifies funding for a set of activities. This list and these funding levels are not exhaustive, as some activities may be conducted as part of multi-sectoral projects with focus areas not limited to conservation. Conservation also may be a secondary objective of programs targeting adjacent issues.Table 1.

R46312,2020-05-05T04:00:00Z,2025-06-20T22:18:22Z,Forest Carbon Primer,"The global carbon cycle is the process by which the element carbon moves between the air, land, ocean, and Earth’s crust. The movement of increasing amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, particularly as greenhouse gases, is the dominant contributor to the observed warming trend in global temperatures. Forests are a significant part of the global carbon cycle, because they contain the largest store of terrestrial (land-based) carbon and continuously transfer carbon between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere. Consequently, forest carbon optimization and management strategies are often included in climate mitigation policy proposals. The forest carbon cycle starts with the sequestration and accumulation of atmospheric carbon due to tree growth. The accumulated carbon is stored in five different pools in the forest ecosystem: aboveground biomass (e.g., leaves, trunks, limbs), belowground biomass (e.g., roots), deadwood, litter (e.g., fallen leaves, stems), and soils. As trees or parts of trees die, the carbon cycles through those different pools, from the living biomass pools to the deadwood, litter, and soil pools. The length of time carbon stays in each pool varies considerably, ranging from months (litter) to millennia (soil). The cycle continues as carbon flows out of the forest ecosystem and returns to the atmosphere through several processes, including respiration, combustion, and decomposition. Carbon also leaves the forest ecosystem through timber harvests, by which it enters the product pool. This carbon is stored in harvested wood products (HWPs) while the products are in use but eventually will return to the atmosphere upon the wood products’ disposal and eventual decomposition, which could take several decades or more. In total, there are seven pools of forest carbon: five in the forest ecosystem and two in the product pool (HWPs in use and HWPs in disposal sites). Carbon is always moving through the pools of forested ecosystems (known as carbon flux). The size of the various pools and the rate at which carbon moves through them vary considerably over time. The amount of carbon sequestered in a forest relative to the amount of carbon that forest releases into the atmosphere is constantly changing with tree growth, death, and decomposition. If the total amount of carbon released into the atmosphere by a given forest over a given period is greater than the amount of carbon sequestered in that forest, the forest is a net source of carbon emissions. If the forest sequesters more carbon than it releases into the atmosphere, the forest is a net sink of carbon. These forest carbon dynamics are driven in large part by different anthropogenic and ecological disturbances. Anthropogenic disturbances are planned activities, such as timber harvests, whereas ecological disturbances are unplanned, such as weather events (e.g., hurricanes, droughts), insect and disease infestations, and wildfires. Generally, disturbances result in tree mortality, causing the transfer of carbon from the living pools to the deadwood, litter, soil, and product pools, and/or eventually to the atmosphere. If a disturbed site regenerates as forest, the carbon releases caused by the disturbance generally are offset over time. If, however, the site changes to a different land use (e.g., agriculture), the carbon releases may not be offset. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) measures forest carbon annually using data collected by the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program in the U.S. Forest Service. According to EPA, U.S. forest carbon stocks contained 58.7 billion metric tons (BMT) of carbon in 2019 across the seven pools, the majority of which was stored in soil (54%). The aboveground biomass pool stored the next-largest portion of forest carbon stocks (26%). The pools’ relative size varies considerably across U.S. forests, however. EPA estimates that, for the forest carbon flux, U.S. forests were a net sink of carbon, having sequestered 221 million metric tons (MMT) of carbon in 2018—an offset of approximately 12% of the gross annual greenhouse gas emissions from the United States for the year. The net sink reflects carbon accumulation on existing forestland and carbon accumulation associated with land converted to forestland within the past 20 years. Within the carbon pools, most of the annual flux is associated with aboveground biomass (58%). In general, the annual net flux of carbon into U.S. forests is small relative to the amount of carbon they store (e.g., 221 MMT of carbon is 0.3% of the 58.7 BMT of total carbon stored in U.S. forests in 2019). There are three primary strategic approaches for optimizing forest carbon sequestration and storage: (1) maintain and increase the area of forestland, (2) maintain and increase forest carbon stocks, and (3) increase the use of wood products as an alternative to more carbon-intensive materials or as a fuel. In many cases, optimizing carbon sequestration and storage may compete with other forest management objectives and require tradeoffs. As such, the applicability of each approach will vary, depending on existing site characteristics and other objectives. In addition, each of these approaches comes with varying levels of uncertainty related to effectiveness and potential for co-benefits. All of these considerations are in the context of the uncertainty related to the future effects of changing climatic conditions on forests broadly.",https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R46312/R46312.5.pdf
