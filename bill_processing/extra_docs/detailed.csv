This section is effective retroactively for taxable years beginning after December 13, 2019.</p><p>(Sec. 112) This section provides a nonrefundable tax credit for small employers that make military-spouse employees eligible for participation in the employer's defined contribution retirement plan during the first two months of employment.</p><p>(Sec. 113) This section permits employers to offer de minimis financial incentives (e.g., low-dollar gift cards) to encourage employee participation in the employer's 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plan. The section prohibits the use of plan assets to pay for the de minimis financial incentives.</p><p>(Sec. 114) This section expands tax incentives for employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) sponsored by S corporations. ESOPs are employer-sponsored defined contribution retirement plans that invest primarily in employer stock. Specifically, this section allows owners of stock in all non-publicly traded domestic corporations, including S corporations, to defer taxes on capital gains realized from selling their stock to an ESOP. Currently, the option to defer capital gains taxes is only available to owners of stock in a non-publicly traded C corporation who sell to an ESOP. Additionally, in the case of a sale of stock in an S corporation to an ESOP, the section limits the amount deferred to 10% of capital gains realized from the sale.</p><p>(Sec. 115) This section allows certain penalty-free early withdrawals from tax-preferred retirement accounts for emergency personal expenses. Under current law, the Internal Revenue Code imposes an early withdrawal tax on distributions made from tax-preferred retirement accounts, such as IRAs and 401ks, before an individual attains age 59 1/2. The early withdrawal tax does not apply in some circumstances.</p><p>(Sec. 116) This section increases the contribution an employer may make to a SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees) IRA or SIMPLE 401(k) plan. SIMPLE IRAs and SIMPLE 401(k) plans are simplified tax-advantaged retirement accounts often provided by small businesses.</p><p>(Sec. 117) This section increases the annual limits for employee contributions and catch-up contributions to a SIMPLE IRA or SIMPLE 401(k) plan.</p><p>(Sec. 118) This section exempts from the 10% excise tax on excess (nondeductible) contributions an employer's contributions to a simplified employee pension (SEP) IRA which are not deductible solely because they are not made in connection with a trade or business of the employer (e.g., contributions on behalf of a household employee). A SEP IRA is an employer-sponsored retirement plan where only the employer contributes to the plan and the employer contributes the same amount for each employee.</p><p>(Sec. 119) This section removes the compensation-based limit on annual benefits under defined benefit plans for participants in rural electric cooperative plans who are not considered to be highly compensated employees.</p><p>(Sec. 120) This section exempts from the tax on specified prohibited transactions the receipt of fees and compensation by an automatic portability provider in connection with an automatic transfer from an IRA established in connection with a distribution from a former employer's plan into an employer-sponsored defined contribution retirement plan in which the individual is an active participant. The transfer may only occur if the individual has been given advance notice of the transfer and has not affirmatively opted out of the transfer.</p><p>Labor must issue guidance and studies related to the exemption. Treasury must issue a report on automatic distribution notices.</p><p>(Sec. 121) This section creates two new types of plans--a starter 401(k) and a safe harbor 403(b)--for employers that do not offer a retirement plan. Among other features of these plans, employees generally enroll with a deferral rate between 3% and 15%. The limit on annual deferrals is $6,000 (indexed for inflation).</p><p>(Sec. 122) This section requires Treasury to provide states with the contact information of owners of unredeemed savings bonds that are more than three years past their date of final maturity.</p><p>(Sec. 123) This section revises the rules with respect to ESOPs to permit certain non-exchange traded securities to qualify as publicly traded employer securities if the security meets certain requirements.</p><p>(Sec. 124) This section increases from 26 to 46 the age before which a qualifying disability must occur for an individual to be eligible for a tax-advantaged ABLE (Achieving Better Life Experience) account. ABLE accounts are designed to enable individuals with disabilities to save for and pay for disability-related expenses. To establish an account, an individual must have a qualifying impairment that began before the individual attained the age threshold.</p><p>(Sec. 125) This section reduces from three years to two years the maximum period of consecutive part-time service an employer may require before an employee is eligible for participation in the employer's 401(k) plan. The section also applies this requirement and other coverage requirements for long-term, part-time workers to 403(b) plans that are subject to ERISA.</p><p>(Sec. 126) This section permits certain rollovers from 529 college savings accounts to Roth IRAs without a tax penalty if the 529 account has been maintained for at least 15 years and certain other conditions are met.</p><p>(Sec. 127) This section creates pension-linked emergency savings accounts, which are short-terms savings accounts established and maintained as part of an individual account plan (e.g., a 401(k) or other defined contribution plan). The section sets forth requirements and features of the emergency savings accounts, including a requirement that savings accounts are funded with after-tax Roth contributions.</p><p>(Sec. 128) This section permits 403(b) plans with custodial accounts to invest in collective investment trusts for the purposes of tax law. (In order to permit 403(b) plans with custodial accounts to invest in collective investment trusts, certain modifications to securities laws will also be required.)</p><p>TITLE II--PRESERVATION OF INCOME</p><p>(Sec. 201) This section permits commercial annuities issued in connection with a defined contribution employer plan or an individual retirement account or annuity to satisfy RMD requirements even if the commercial annuities provide certain types of payments, such as annual payment increases of less than 5%, payments of dividends and distributions, and certain lump sum payments.</p><p>(Sec. 202) This section directs Treasury to revise its regulations governing qualifying longevity annuity contracts (QLACs). QLACs generally are deferred annuities that begin payment at the end of an individual's life expectancy.</p><p>Under the existing regulations, premiums paid for a qualifying QLAC cannot exceed both a dollar limitation ($145,000 for 2022) and a percentage limitation. This section repeals the requirement that premiums for QLACs be limited to 25% of an individual's account balance and permits the use of up to $200,000 (indexed for inflation) from an account balance to purchase a QLAC.</p><p>The section also requires Treasury to make certain changes intended to facilitate the sale of QLACs with spousal survivor rights.</p><p>(Sec. 203) This section directs Treasury to revise its rules to facilitate the use of exchange-traded funds as investment options in variable contracts (e.g., variable annuity life insurance policies). Exchange-traded funds are collective investment products registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission the shares of which, unlike mutual funds, are traded on a national stock exchange at market prices.</p><p>(Sec. 204) This section directs Treasury to amend its RMD regulations to allow an employee who has an individual account in a defined contribution plan that is partially annuitized (i.e., that holds annuity contracts and other assets) to elect to calculate the RMD amount by aggregating the value of the annuities and the other portion of the account balance.</p><p>TITLE III--SIMPLIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION OF RETIREMENT PLAN RULES</p><p>This title modifies rules governing the design, implementation, and administration of retirement plans that qualify for preferred tax treatment (i.e., tax-qualified retirement plans) under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).</p><p>The title also makes changes to the regulation of employee benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Security Income Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA establishes minimum standards and requirements intended to protect plan participants and beneficiaries in most private sector employer-sponsored retirement and health plans.</p><p>The title addresses issues such as error correction requirements, withdrawal and distribution rules, and notice and disclosure rules.</p><p>(Sec. 301) This section establishes new rules applicable to inadvertent overpayments by plans under ERISA and the IRC. A fiduciary does not breach fiduciary duty for failing to recover an inadvertent overpayment. Also, a plan will not fail to be tax-qualified because it does not recover an inadvertent overpayment. The section sets forth applicable requirements and conditions.</p><p>(Sec. 302) This section reduces the excise tax on a taxpayer who fails to satisfy the RMD requirements under a qualified retirement plan or 457(b) plan. Specifically, it reduces the excise tax from 50% to 25% of the amount by which the minimum required distribution exceeds the amount actually distributed and further reduces the excise tax to 10% for a taxpayer who corrects the error during a two-year correction window.</p><p>(Sec. 303) This section directs Labor to establish an online searchable database—the Retirement Savings Lost and Found—to allow individuals to search for information and locate the administrator of various plans.</p><p>(Sec. 304) This section raises the cap from $5,000 to $7,000 on the amount of vested accrued benefits that a qualified retirement plan may involuntarily distribute to an IRA (or cash out if under $1,000), such as when a job change occurs.</p><p>(Sec. 305) This section expands the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (EPCRS) to allow any eligible inadvertent failure to comply with rules under specified sections of the IRC to be self-corrected under the EPCRS, unless the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) identifies the error first or the self-correction was not completed in a reasonable time. The term <em>eligible inadvertent failure </em>means a failure that occurs despite the existence of practices and procedures that satisfy IRS standards or similar standards in the case of an individual retirement plan.</p><p>The section also directs the IRS to expand the EPCRS to allow (1) custodians of individual retirement accounts and annuities to address eligible inadvertent failures, including waivers of the excise tax that would otherwise apply; and (2) certain eligible inadvertent failures related to a loan from a plan to be self-corrected.</p><p>(Sec. 306) This section allows participants in governmental 457(b) plans to change their deferral rate at any time before the compensation is available (instead of prior to the beginning of the month in which the deferral will be made).</p><p>(Sec. 307) This section expands the tax deduction for qualified charitable distributions (QCDs). A <em>QCD </em>is a nontaxable distribution by a taxpayer aged 70 1/2 or older transferred directly from a traditional or Roth IRA to a charitable organization. Currently, the maximum annual exclusion is $100,000 (not indexed). This section indexes the $100,000 maximum annual exclusion to inflation. It also permits a one-time election of up to $50,000 (indexed for inflation) for QCDs to a split-interest entity (e.g., a charitable remainder annuity trust).</p><p>(Sec. 308) This section exempts certain private sector firefighters from the 10% additional tax on early distributions from retirement plans.</p><p>(Sec. 309) This section permits first responders to exclude certain disability-connected retirement payments from gross income. The exclusion applies to payments received as a pension or annuity from certain retirement plans in connection with the individual's service as a law enforcement officer, firefighter, paramedic, or emergency medical technician.</p><p>(Sec. 310) This section modifies the application of certain top-heavy rules for a defined contribution plan that covers employees who do not meet the minimum age or service requirements under the IRC. Currently, an employer-sponsored defined contribution plan that is top heavy (i.e., more than 60% of the aggregate accrued benefits or account balances are for certain key employees) must satisfy certain minimum vesting and minimum benefit requirements to maintain its tax-qualified status. This section allows the plan to exclude employees who do not meet the minimum age or service requirements in determining whether the plan satisfies minimum vesting and minimum benefit requirements.</p><p>(Sec. 311) This section restricts to three years the period during which a qualified birth or adoption distribution may be repaid to a retirement plan. Current law allows an individual to take a penalty-free early distribution from certain defined contribution retirement plans of up to $5,000 for a qualified birth or adoption.</p><p>(Sec. 312) This section allows 401(k) and 403(b) plans to rely on an employee's written self-certification that a deemed hardship distribution is due to an immediate and heavy financial need and is limited to the amount required to satisfy that financial need. Similarly, the section allows 457(b) plans to rely on a participant's written self-certification that a deemed unforeseeable emergency distribution meets applicable conditions (i.e., the participant is faced with an unforeseeable emergency and the distribution is not in excess of the amount required to satisfy the emergency need).</p><p>(Sec. 313) This section establishes statutes of limitation under the IRC with respect to imposing an excise tax for excess contributions to an IRA or for failing to comply with the RMD rules.</p><p>(Sec. 314) This section allows a domestic abuse victim to take a penalty-free early distribution of up to $10,000 (inflation adjusted) from an eligible retirement plan that is not a defined benefit plan or a joint and survivor annuity.</p><p>(Sec. 315) This section modifies two stock attribution rules with respect to the aggregation of related businesses when determining compliance with nondiscrimination requirements. First, it requires community property laws to be disregarded for the purposes of determining ownership. Second, it modifies the attribution requirements between parents and minor children.</p><p>(Sec. 316) This section allows an employer to adopt an amendment to a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan that is beneficial to participants prior to the employer's tax filing deadline. (Under current law, plan amendments to an existing plan must generally be adopted by the last day of the plan year in which the amendment is effective.)</p><p>(Sec. 317) This section permits sole proprietors who establish a new tax-exempt retirement plan after the end of a taxable year (but before their tax filing date) to treat contributions made before the tax filing date as elective deferrals during the prior taxable year. An elective deferral is an amount contributed to certain tax-qualified retirement plans (e.g., 401(k), 403(b), SIMPLE IRA plans) by an employer at the employee's election and which, except to the extent they are designated Roth contributions, are excludable from the employee's gross income.</p><p>(Sec. 318) This section directs Labor to promulgate regulations under ERISA's fiduciary requirements that allow employee health or retirement plans to use a benchmark that is a blend of broad-based securities market indices to meet the performance benchmarking requirements for designated investment alternatives. The section also requires Labor to report on the utilization, and participants' understanding, of the benchmarking requirements.</p><p>(Sec. 319) This section requires Labor, Treasury, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to review and report on the effectiveness of reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to retirement plans under ERISA and the IRC. The report must also include recommendations to consolidate, simplify, standardize, and improve the reporting and disclosure requirements.</p><p>(Sec. 320) This section modifies the disclosure requirements applicable to unenrolled participants in employer-sponsored defined contribution plans. Specifically, the section provides that ongoing plan disclosures are not required to be provided to unenrolled participants so long as the unenrolled participants are provided with an annual reminder of their eligibility to participate in the plan and any documents they request.</p><p>(Sec. 321) This section directs Labor to review its interpretive bulletin related to the fiduciary standards when selecting an annuity provider for a defined benefit pension plan and consult with the ERISA advisory council to determine if changes are needed. It also requires Labor to report on its findings, including an assessment of any risk to participants.</p><p>(Sec. 322) This section modifies the tax treatment of certain IRAs involved in a prohibited transaction (e.g., a transaction where an IRA buys investment property from the IRA owner). Currently, if there is a prohibited transaction in an IRA, the IRA loses its tax-favored status and the fair market value of the assets in the entire IRA are treated as distributed to the owner. This section specifies that if an individual has multiple IRAs, they are treated separately with respect to prohibited transactions.</p><p>(Sec. 323) This section specifies that the exemption from the 10% additional tax on early withdrawals from retirement plans for distributions that are substantially equal periodic payments made over the account owner's life expectancy applies in the case of a rollover of the account, an exchange of the annuity providing the payments, or an annuity that meets the RMD requirements.</p><p>(Sec. 324) This section directs Treasury to develop and issue guidance in the form of sample forms to simplify, standardize, facilitate, and expedite the completion of rollovers to eligible retirement plans and trustee-to-trustee transfers from an IRA to another individual retirement account or annuity.</p><p>(Sec. 325) This section exempts designated Roth accounts that are included in employer-sponsored retirement plans from the RMD rules prior to the participant's death.</p><p>(Sec. 326) This section allows penalty-free early distributions from retirement plans for individuals who have a terminal illness.</p><p>(Sec. 327) This section permits surviving spouses to elect to be treated as the deceased employee for purposes of the RMD requirements.</p><p>(Sec. 328) This section eliminates the requirement that certain distributions from a governmental retirement plan for the health or long-term care insurance premiums of a retired public safety officer must be paid directly to the insurance plan for such amount to be excluded from the retired officer's gross income.</p><p>(Sec. 329) This section exempts from the 10% additional tax on early withdrawals distributions under a governmental plan to public safety employees with at least 25 years of service under the plan, regardless of their age.</p><p>(Sec. 330) This section extends the public safety employee exception to the 10% additional tax on early withdrawals to distributions under a governmental plan to corrections officers and certain forensic security employees.</p><p>(Sec. 331) This section allows penalty-free early withdrawals from retirement plans in connection with a federally declared disaster. It permits distributions of up to $22,000 per participant, per disaster.</p><p>(Sec. 332) This section permits an employer to replace a SIMPLE IRA plan with a safe harbor 401(k) plan at any time during the year. The section also provides a waiver of certain rollover rules for a conversion of a SIMPLE IRA to a 401(k) plan or 403(b) plan.</p><p>(Sec. 333) This section allows penalty-free early withdrawals from an IRA of any excess contribution amount (and associated earnings) included in a corrective distribution.</p><p>(Sec. 334) This section permits employer-sponsored defined contribution retirement plans to make penalty-free distributions of up to $2,500 per year (inflation adjusted) to pay the premiums for long-term care insurance that meets certain standards.</p><p>(Sec. 335) This section directs Treasury to revise its minimum funding regulations for defined benefit plans to limit the mortality improvement rate that is used to calculate the present value of a stream of expected future benefit payments.</p><p>(Sec. 336) This section requires the Government Accountability Office to report on the effectiveness of notices provided by plans to participants about distributions eligible for rollover treatment.</p><p>(Sec. 337) This section modifies the RMD rules for special needs trusts, including by allowing the special needs trust to provide for a charitable organization as the remainder beneficiary.</p><p>(Sec. 338) This section requires a certain number of periodic benefit statements to be provided in paper form. Specifically, it generally requires a participant in a defined contribution plan to receive one quarterly statement in paper form each year, and it requires a participant in a defined benefit plan to receive one quarterly statement in paper form every three years.</p><p>(Sec. 339) This section adds tribal courts to the list of courts eligible to issue qualified domestic relations orders with respect to providing distributions to alternate payees under ERISA and the IRC.</p><p>(Sec. 340) This section requires Labor to review its regulations related to fiduciary disclosure requirements in participant-directed individual account plans. Currently, the regulation requires plan administrators to disclose certain plan and investment-related information, including fee and expense information, to participants and beneficiaries. This section requires Labor to explore improvements to enhance participants' understanding of fees and expenses related to a defined contribution plan under ERISA, as well as the cumulative effect of the fees and expenses on retirement savings over time.</p><p>(Sec. 341) This section directs Labor and Treasury to adopt regulations providing that a plan can consolidate certain required notices.</p><p>(Sec. 342) This section requires a pension plan administrator that is amending the plan in order to provide participants with the option to elect a lump sum payment to provide the participants with certain information about the available benefit options, including an explanation about how the lump sum was calculated.</p><p>(Sec. 343) This section modifies requirements regarding the annual funding notices for a defined benefit plan, including by requiring the plan to provide the average return on assets for the plan year.</p><p>(Sec. 344) This section requires Labor to report on the pooled employer plan (PEP) industry. The report must include the legal name and number of PEPs, as well as other information such as the number of participants, the range of investment options provided, and the fees assessed in the plans. The report must also include legislative recommendations to improve PEPs.</p><p>(Sec. 345) This section provides that plans that are part of a group of plans only need to submit an audit if they have 100 or more participants.</p><p>(Sec. 346) This section establishes an Employee Ownership Initiative within Labor to promote employee ownership. It authorizes grants for education, training, and technical assistance to support existing programs and create new programs at the state level.</p><p>(Sec. 347) This section directs Labor to study the impact of inflation on retirement savings.</p><p>(Sec. 348) This section provides a statutory maximum of 6% for the projected interest crediting rate for certain hybrid defined benefit plans that provide variable interest crediting rates. Hybrid defined benefit plans generally are those that express a participant's accumulated benefits as a lump sum based on a benefit formula.</p><p>(Sec. 349) This section establishes a maximum variable-rate pension insurance premium of $52 per $1,000 of unfunded vested benefits in a defined benefit pension plan.</p><p>(Sec. 350) This section extends and provides statutory authority for the IRS safe harbor period for employers to correct reasonable administrative errors with respect to the automatic enrollment or automatic escalation features of an employer-sponsored retirement plan.</p><p>Specifically, this section provides a 9 1/2 month-period after the end of a plan year to correct such errors beginning in plan year 2024. Current guidance sunsets the safe harbor correction method after 2023.</p><p>TITLE IV--TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS</p><p>(Sec. 401) This section makes various technical amendments to the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019 (SECURE Act), such as revising the notice requirements for certain automatic contribution arrangements.</p><p>TITLE V--ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS</p><p>(Sec. 501) This section permits certain retirement plan amendments made pursuant to this act until the end of plan year 2025 (or plan year 2027 for governmental plans).</p><p>It also harmonizes these time periods with the plan amendment dates under the SECURE Act; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act); and the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020.</p><p>TITLE VI--REVENUE PROVISIONS</p><p>(Sec. 601) This section permits employers and employees to make after-tax Roth contributions to SIMPLE IRAs and SEP plans.</p><p>(Sec. 602) This section provides statutory authority to make certain amounts available for hardship distributions under 403(b) plans, including employer matching contributions and earnings on contributions.</p><p>(Sec. 603) This section requires catch-up contributions by individuals earning more than $145,000 per year (indexed for inflation) to be made as after-tax Roth contributions. This requirement does not apply to SIMPLE or SEP IRAs.</p><p>(Sec. 604) This section permits participants in defined contribution plans to elect to receive employer matching contributions on an after-tax Roth basis.</p><p>(Sec. 605) This section imposes a limitation on the tax deduction for qualified conservation contributions made by certain partnerships if the amount of the contribution exceeds 2.5% times the sum of each partner's relevant basis in the partnership. This limitation also applies to other pass-through entities, such as S corporations.</p><p>(Sec. 606) This section extends through 2032 the period of time during which a pension plan that is overfunded may transfer excess assets to pay retiree health and life insurance benefits. It also provides for de minimis transfers to pay for such benefits if a plan meets certain funding requirements.</p><p>TITLE VII--TAX COURT RETIREMENT PROVISIONS</p><p>(Sec. 701) This section allows U.S. Tax Court judges to receive automatic and matching employer contributions under a Thrift Saving Plan (TSP).

For example, this section establishes through FY2027 the annual base revenue and various adjustments. (The base revenue and various adjustments set the total amount of user fees that the FDA must collect through the particular user fee program each fiscal year.)</p> <p>For the purposes of setting drug user fees, the FDA must make various adjustments including (1) increasing the fees collected each fiscal year for strategic hiring and retention purposes, and (2) adjusting the fees collected for each fiscal year by employing the capacity planning method the FDA used to set such fees for FY2021.</p> <p>This section also establishes that a human drug application for a skin-test diagnostic product shall not be subject to certain fees.</p> <p>Furthermore, this section establishes a rule for fees for an approved human prescription drug that was on the discontinued list on the first day of a fiscal year but is no longer on the list later in the same fiscal year.

For example, the section establishes the total revenue amounts to be generated from such fees for each fiscal year through FY2027.</p> <p>For the purpose of calculating such user fees, this section also authorizes increases for various purposes. For example, for FY2025-FY2027, the base establishment registration fee amounts shall be increased by specified amounts to meet improved performance goals for reviewing certain medical device applications. Other adjustments required by this section include decreases in the amount to be collected for such user fees if (1) the FDA's hiring to support the medical device application process is below certain thresholds, or (2) operating reserves for medical device application review operations exceed certain thresholds.</p> <p>(Sec. 2005) This section permanently reauthorizes and modifies a program under which accredited testing laboratories are involved in assessing whether a medical device complies with certain statutory requirements. Currently, such a laboratory shall assess whether a device conforms to the relevant requirements.

For example, this section establishes through FY2027 the annual base revenue amount and various adjustments to set the total amount that the FDA must collect each fiscal year for the particular user fee program.</p> <p>The FDA must establish a capacity planning methodology to meet the resource capacity needed for the FDA's human generic drug activities and increase the revenue collected under this user fee program accordingly.</p> <p>The FDA may also increase the user fees assessed for a fiscal year to meet certain operating reserve thresholds for the FDA's human generic drug activities. If the operating reserve increases above certain thresholds, the FDA must reduce the user fees accordingly.</p> <p>(Sec. 3004) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to human generic drugs, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority.</p> <p>TITLE IV--FEES RELATING TO BIOSIMILAR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS</p> <p><em>Biosimilar User Fee Amendments of 2022</em></p> <p>(Sec. 4002) This section amends the definition of <em>biosimilar biological product application </em>to include a qualifying application for an allergenic extract product. Currently, applications for allergenic extract products are specifically excluded from the definition.</p> <p>(Sec. 4003) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses biosimilar biological product user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees.

Woolsey Post Office Building.</p> <p>DIVISION A--MENTAL HEALTH AND FIREARMS PROVISIONS</p> <p>TITLE I--CHILDREN AND FAMILY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES</p> <p>This title reauthorizes, funds, and supports programs, grants, and activities that provide access to mental and behavioral health.</p> <p>(Sec. 11001) This section extends through September 30, 2025, the Medicaid demonstration program for certified community behavioral health clinics. It also expands the program by increasing the number of states that may participate and increasing the length of the demonstration programs. It provides funding for planning grants, technical assistance, and the demonstration programs.</p> <p>(Sec. 11002) This section requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide technical assistance and issue guidance to states on ways to improve access to telehealth under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).</p> <p>(Sec. 11003) This section requires and provides funding for the CMS to (1) issue guidance to support the delivery of medical assistance to Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries in school-based settings; and (2) establish a technical assistance center to expand the capacity of state Medicaid agencies, local educational agencies, and school-based entities to provide assistance under Medicaid.</p> <p>This section also authorizes grants for states to implement, enhance, or expand non-health related services through school-based entities under Medicaid and CHIP.</p> <p>(Sec. 11004) This section requires and provides funding for the CMS to regularly review and report on states' implementation of federal requirements to provide early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services for children enrolled in Medicaid. The review must address the provision of the services by managed care plans. </p> <p>Additionally, this section requires the Government Accountability Office to evaluate and report on state compliance with the requirements to provide early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services for children enrolled in Medicaid.</p> <p>(Sec. 11005) This section reauthorizes through FY2027 pediatric mental health care access grants and allows grants to be used to provide information, support, training, and technical assistance to emergency departments, educational agencies, and schools.</p> <p>TITLE II--FIREARMS</p> <p>This title makes various changes to federal firearms laws, including to expand background check requirements for persons who are under 21 years of age, to establish new criminal offenses for straw purchasing of firearms and trafficking in firearms, and to extend federal firearms-related restrictions to individuals convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors against dating partners.</p> <p>(Sec. 12001) This section establishes additional requirements for firearms-related background checks through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) for prospective purchasers who are 18 to 21 years of age. </p> <p>Specifically, if a federal firearms licensee (e.g., a gun dealer) contacts the NICS to initiate a firearms-related background check on a person who is 18 to 21 years of age, then this section requires the NICS to contact additional record systems&#8212;state criminal history or juvenile justice repositories, state custodians of mental health records, and local law enforcement agencies&#8212;for possibly disqualifying juvenile records. Current law already requires the NICS to query national data systems for disqualifying records of an individual who is prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm.</p> <p>Additionally, if cause exists to further investigate a possibly disqualifying juvenile record of a person who is 18 to 21 years of age, then this section allows a firearm transfer to be delayed for up to 10 business days. </p> <p>The requirement for the NICS to contact additional record systems expires in 10 years.</p> <p>(Sec. 12002) This section revises the definition of <em>engaged in the business</em> as applicable to a firearms dealer who is required to be federally licensed. Specifically, it provides that a person who sells firearms to predominantly earn a profit (currently, who sells firearms with the principal objective of livelihood and profit) is engaged in the business of dealing in firearms and is therefore required to be federally licensed.</p> <p>(Sec. 12003) This section allows grants under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program to be used to implement state crisis intervention programs or initiatives, including mental health courts, drug courts, veterans' courts, and extreme risk protection order programs (i.e., red flag laws).</p> <p>(Sec. 12004) This section establishes a federal statutory framework to prohibit straw purchasing of firearms, trafficking in firearms, and related conduct. </p> <p>A violator is subject to criminal and civil penalties, including the seizure and forfeiture of the firearms and ammunition involved in the offense, property constituting or derived from proceeds from the offense, and property used to commit or facilitate the offense.</p> <p>The section authorizes law enforcement to investigate straw purchasing and trafficking in firearms offenses using wiretaps (i.e., authorized interceptions of wire, electronic, or oral communications) and makes the offenses predicate offenses (i.e., underlying offenses) for prosecutions under the federal money laundering statute and the federal racketeering statute.</p> <p>(Sec. 12005) This section extends federal firearms-related restrictions to individuals who are convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence against an individual in a current or recent former dating relationship. Currently, the restrictions generally only apply to individuals who are convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor against a co-parent of a child, a current or former spouse, a current or former cohabitant as a spouse, or a person similarly situated to a spouse. </p> <p>The term<em> dating relationship</em> means a continuing relationship of a serious or intimate nature, as determined based on the length of the relationship, the nature of the relationship, and the frequency and type of interaction between the individuals involved in the relationship.</p> <p>This section specifies that for individuals who are convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence against a dating partner, the federal firearms-related restrictions apply only to convictions on or after the date of enactment and expire five years after the conviction date if certain conditions are met.</p> <p>TITLE III--OTHER MATTERS</p> <p>Subtitle A--Extension of Moratorium</p> <p>(Sec. 13101) This section delays for one year the implementation of regulations relating to the treatment of certain Medicare prescription drug benefit rebates from drug manufacturers for purposes of federal anti-kickback laws.</p> <p>Subtitle B--Medicare Improvement Fund</p> <p>(Sec. 13201) This section appropriates funds for the Medicare Improvement Fund in FY2022.</p> <p>Subtitle C--Luke and Alex School Safety Act of 2022</p> <p><em>Luke and Alex School Safety Act of 2022</em></p> <p>(Sec. 13302) This section provides statutory authority for the federal clearinghouse of school safety resources. The clearinghouse identifies and publishes best practices and recommendations for school safety for use by state and local educational and law enforcement agencies, institutions of higher education, health professionals, and the public.</p> <p>(Sec. 13303) This section requires the Department of Health and Human Services and the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and Education to notify their state and local counterparts and other partners about the clearinghouse.</p> <p>(Sec. 13304) This section requires the clearinghouse or the external advisory board to review and report on federal grant programs that could be used to implement best practices and recommendations. This section also requires the clearinghouse to identify state agencies, state grant programs, and other resources that may be used to implement best practices and recommendations.</p> <p>Subtitle D--Amendment on ESEA Funding</p> <p>(Sec. 13401) This section prohibits the use of elementary and secondary education funds to provide any person with a dangerous weapon or training in the use of a dangerous weapon. </p> <p>DIVISION B--APPROPRIATIONS</p> <p><em>Bipartisan Safer Communities Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022</em></p> <p>This division provides FY2022 supplemental appropriations to various federal departments and agencies for programs and activities to support behavioral and mental health.

The compacts are the agreements that govern the relationship of the United States with the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), and the Republic of Palau, collectively referred to as the Freely Associated States (FAS). The title also addresses other issues related to the FAS, including by authorizing various U.S. assistance to the FAS. </p> <p>(Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau are sovereign states that, through the Compacts of Free Association, receive U.S. economic assistance and allow the United States to operate military bases in their territory. Citizens of the FAS have the right to work and reside in the United States and may serve in the U.S. Armed Forces.)</p> <p>(Sec. 204) This section provides congressional approval for (1) the 2023 Agreement to Amend the U.S.-FSM Compact, (2) the 2023 U.S.-FSM Trust Fund Agreement, (3) the 2023 Agreement to Amend the U.S.-RMI Compact, (4) the 2023 U.S.-RMI Trust Fund Agreement, (5) and the 2023 U.S.-Palau Compact Review Agreement.

For example, any amendment or termination of the amended Compacts of Free Association may not enter into force until Congress has incorporated the change in an act. Any changes to subsidiary agreements may not enter into force until 90 days after the President has reported certain information to Congress.</p> <p>(Sec. 205) This section addresses issues relating to provisions in the amended U.S.-FSM Compact, the agreement between the United States and Micronesia. </p> <p>The U.S. government must provide nonreimbursable technical and training assistance, as appropriate, to enable the government of Micronesia to (1) develop and adequately enforce its own laws, and (2) cooperate with U.S. efforts to enforce U.S. laws.</p> <p>This section also addresses issues related to U.S. appointees to various committees established by the amended agreement, including the term lengths and qualifications of such appointees.</p> <p>(Sec. 206) This section addresses issues related to provisions in the amended U.S.-RMI Compact, the agreement between the United States and the Marshall Islands. </p> <p>The U.S. government must provide nonreimbursable technical and training assistance, as appropriate, to enable the government of the Marshall Islands to (1) develop and adequately enforce its own laws, and (2) cooperate with U.S. efforts to enforce U.S. laws.</p> <p>The Department of the Interior (Interior) may provide grants to the government of the Marshall Islands to carry out a planting and agricultural maintenance program on Bikini, Enewetak, Rongelap, and Utrik.

The GAO must periodically report to Congress on various topics about each of the FAS, such as the (1) general social, political, and economic conditions; (2) use and effectiveness of U.S. assistance; and (3) status of economic policy reforms. </p> <p>The section provides authorities to Interior and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to fulfill responsibilities for monitoring and managing funds related to the FAS.</p> <p>The President must establish an Interagency Group on Freely Associated States to (1) coordinate the development and implementation of activities related to the FAS, and (2) provide recommendations and oversight to federal agencies with respect to the agreements. </p> <p>This section also reaffirms that the foreign loans or debt of the governments of the FAS do not constitute an obligation of the United States, and that the full faith and credit of the U.S. government shall not apply to such loans or debt without specific further authorization. </p> <p>(Sec. 209) This section addresses U.S. activities in the FAS, including medical care for veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces and grants related to education.</p> <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may furnish hospital care and medical services in the FAS to a veteran who is otherwise eligible to receive such care and services. Such care and services may be provided for any condition even if the condition is not connected to the veteran's service. Before providing the care and services, the VA must enter into agreements with the governments of the FAS regarding various issues, including the licensure and certification of the health care personnel providing the care and services. </p> <p>The VA may also pay the travel expenses of an individual to travel to, from, or within the FAS to receive such hospital care and medical services.</p> <p>The VA may also continue to provide medical care and travel benefits to a veteran who received such care and services regardless of whether the country continues to qualify as an FAS. </p> <p>Subject to the availability of appropriations, the VA must conduct outreach to and engage with each government of the FAS and increase staffing as necessary to conduct such outreach. </p> <p>This section also requires the U.S. government to continue to make available to the FAS certain education-related grants and assistance, including grants under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, to the extent such grants continue to be available in the United States. For certain grant programs that are currently available to one or some of the FAS, such as certain assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (currently available to Palau), the United States must continue to offer such assistance and make such assistance available in Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. </p> <p>Other than the grants specifically named in this section, the Department of Education may not provide a grant under any formula grant program to the FAS.</p> <p>This section also extends the Head Start program to Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.

Palau shall also be eligible for services provided by the Legal Services Corporation, the Public Health Service, and the Rural Housing Service.</p> <p>This section also relaxes requirements related to federal public benefits for FAS citizens who lawfully reside in the United States. For example, many non-U.S. nationals (<i>aliens</i> under federal law) are generally not eligible for federal means-tested benefits for five years starting from when the individual entered the United States. Current law provides an exception for FAS citizens who lawfully reside in the United States to receive Medicaid without this five-year waiting period. This section expands this exception to allow FAS citizens to receive other federal means-tested public benefits without the waiting period. </p> <p>The Department of the Treasury must consult with the Asian Development Bank and relevant international financial institutions concerning assistance to the FAS.</p> <p>The Department of State must establish a unit with the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs to address issues relating to the FAS, including managing relationships with the FAS.</p> <p>(Sec. 210) This section establishes that appropriations for certain activities required by the Compacts of Free Association shall be made directly to the federal agencies carrying out the activities.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has <a href=""https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-05/hr3746_Letter_McCarthy.pdf"">estimated</a> that the spending limits will reduce spending below the levels included in its baseline projections. </p> <p>In addition, this section extends and establishes new limits for several adjustments to discretionary spending limits that are permitted under current law to accommodate additional appropriations for certain activities. These adjustments apply to spending for </p> <ul> <li> continuing disability reviews and redeterminations, </li> <li> health care fraud and abuse control, and </li> <li> reemployment services and eligibility assessments.</li> </ul> <p>The section also extends the adjustment to discretionary spending limits for disaster relief funding. The limits for this adjustment are based on a statutory formula, which is modified by this section. </p> <p>During FY2026-FY2029, if the annual budget resolution has not been adopted by Congress by April 15, this section requires the chairman of the House Budget Committee to submit to the House a spending allocation for the House Appropriations Committee that is consistent with levels specified in this section. </p> <p>Finally, the section provides funding for (1) the Department of Veterans Affairs Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, and (2) the Department of Commerce Nonrecurring Expenses Fund. </p> <p>(Sec. 102) This section requires the discretionary spending limits to be revised if a continuing resolution (CR) is in effect at the beginning of the calendar year. </p> <p>Specifically, if a CR for FY2024 or FY2025 is in effect on or after January 1 of 2024 or 2025 for any discretionary budget account, the discretionary spending limits for that fiscal year must be revised to specified levels. CBO has <a href=""https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-05/hr3746_Letter_McCarthy.pdf"">estimated</a> that the revised limits will be lower for defense spending and higher for nondefense spending compared to the original limits. </p> <p>If all of the regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year are enacted before April 30, the revised limits revert to the original limits. If a CR is in effect on April 30 of 2024 or 2025, a final sequestration order must be issued based on the revised limits. </p> <p>(Sec. 103) This section exempts specified funds that were previously designated as emergency spending from the discretionary spending limits. </p> <p>TITLE II--BUDGET ENFORCEMENT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES </p> <p>(Sec. 111) This section requires the chairman of the House Budget Committee to submit for publication in the Congressional Record FY2024 committee allocations, aggregate spending levels, and aggregate revenue levels consistent with this division. </p> <p>The allocations, aggregates, and levels submitted by the chairman are enforceable in the House of Representatives as if they were included in a FY2024 congressional budget resolution. </p> <p>The chairman may adjust the levels to reflect (1) changes resulting from CBO's updates to it baseline for FY2024-FY2033, or (2) legislation that would not increase the deficit over either FY2024-FY2028 or FY2024-FY2033. </p> <p>This section expires if Congress agrees to a budget resolution for FY2024. </p> <p>(Sec. 112) This section sets forth limitations that apply to advance appropriations in the House of Representatives. </p> <p>(Sec. 113) This section specifies that this title is enacted under the rulemaking powers of the House of Representatives and will be considered part of the rules of the House. It also recognizes that the House has the authority to change these rules. </p> <p>TITLE III--BUDGET ENFORCEMENT IN THE SENATE </p> <p>(Sec. 121) This section requires the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to submit for publication in the Congressional Record FY2024 committee allocations, aggregate spending and revenue levels, and levels of Social Security revenues and outlays consistent with this division. The chairman may also include the deficit neutral reserve fund contained in the FY2022 budget resolution, updated by two fiscal years. </p> <p>The allocations, aggregates, and levels submitted by the chairman are enforceable in the Senate as if they were included in a FY2024 congressional budget resolution. This section expires if Congress agrees to a budget resolution for FY2024. </p> <p>(Sec. 122) After April 15, 2024, but not later than May 15, 2024, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee must submit for publication in the Congressional Record FY2025 committee allocations, aggregate spending and revenue levels, and levels of Social Security revenues and outlays consistent with this division. The chairman may also include the deficit neutral reserve fund contained in the FY2022 budget resolution, updated by three fiscal years. </p> <p>After April 15, 2024, the allocations, aggregates, and levels submitted by the chairman are enforceable in the Senate as if they were included in a FY2025 congressional budget resolution. This section expires if Congress agrees to a budget resolution for FY2025. </p> <p>(Sec. 123) This section sets forth limitations and budget enforcement procedures that apply to advance appropriations in the Senate. </p> <p>(Sec. 124) This section specifies that this title is enacted under the rulemaking powers of the Senate and will be considered part of the rules of the Senate. It also recognizes that the Senate has the authority to change these rules. </p> <p> DIVISION B--SAVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS</p> <p>TITLE I--RESCISSION OF UNOBLIGATED FUNDS </p> <p>This title rescinds

Act of 2022). </p> <p>TITLE III--STATUTORY ADMINISTRATIVE PAY-AS-YOU-GO</p> <p><i>Administrative Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2023</i></p> <p>This title provides statutory authority for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administrative pay-as-you-go procedures.</p> <p>(Sec. 263) This section requires federal agencies to submit at least one proposal to reduce direct spending (i.e., mandatory spending) before taking a discretionary administrative action that increases direct spending. The proposed reduction must be greater than or equal to the increase in direct spending attributable to the administrative action.</p> <p>Further, if an agency determines an administrative action that increases direct spending is required by law, and therefore not subject to these requirements, the agency must submit to the OMB (1) its legal basis for concluding that the action is not discretionary, and (2) the projected increase in direct spending under the least costly implementation option that is reasonably identifiable.</p> <p>(Sec. 264) This section requires the OMB to issue administrative guidance regarding these requirements. </p> <p>(Sec. 265) This section permits the OMB to waive these requirements if a waiver is necessary for (1) the delivery of essential services, or (2) effective program delivery. </p> <p>(Sec. 266) This section exempts administrative actions from these requirements if the direct spending cost of the action is less than (1) $1 billion over the 10-year period beginning with the current year, or (2) $100 million in any given year over such period. </p> <p>(Sec. 267) Determinations, findings, and actions related to these requirements are not subject to judicial review. </p> <p>(Sec. 268) These requirements expire on December 31, 2024. </p> <p>(Sec. 269) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) must report on the implementation of these requirements. </p> <p>(Sec. 270) The GAO also must include an assessment of an agency's compliance with these requirements in its report for a major rule under the Congressional Review Act. </p> <p>TITLE IV--TERMINATION OF SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS ON FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS; RESUMPTION OF ACCRUAL OF INTEREST AND COLLECTIONS </p> <p>(Sec. 271) This section terminates the suspension of (1) federal student loan payments, (2) the application of a 0% interest rate on these loans, and (3) involuntary collections on these loans. This termination takes effect 60 days after June 30, 2023. </p> <p>The section also prohibits the Department of Education from implementing any executive action or rule that extends any of these suspensions unless the action is expressly authorized by Congress. </p> <p>DIVISION C--GROW THE ECONOMY </p> <p>TITLE I--TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE TO NEEDY FAMILIES </p> <p>This title makes various changes to the work requirements and other aspects of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. </p> <p>(Sec. 301) This section changes the comparison year for calculating the caseload reduction credit from FY2005 to FY2015. Under current law, states must meet a mandatory work participation rate by ensuring that a specified percentage of families that receive TANF assistance participate in work-related activities. However, a state may earn a caseload reduction credit to lower that rate by reducing its caseload of families receiving TANF assistance as compared to its caseload in FY2005. This section changes the comparison year to FY2015. </p> <p>(Sec. 302) This section requires the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants to up to five states for piloting alternative ways to measure the states' performance in improving employment and earnings outcomes and other indicators of family stability and well-being for TANF recipients. </p> <p>(Sec. 303) This section restricts a practice whereby some states provide a limited amount of TANF assistance to families as a supplement to benefits that the families receive under another program, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and then count those families when determining the work participation rate. </p> <p>Specifically, the section requires that states must provide those families with a benefit of at least $35 per month (funded with state expenditures) in order to count the families when determining the work participation rate. </p> <p>(Sec. 304) This section requires states to report metrics related to the employment and educational outcomes of individuals who exit the TANF program. Specifically, states must report on the employment rate for individuals in unsubsidized employment following their exit from the program and their median earnings. Additionally, states must report on the percentage of individuals under age 24 who obtain a high school degree or equivalent while in the TANF program or within a year of their exit. </p> <p>(Sec. 305) This section makes the changes to the TANF program generally effective on October 1, 2024. However, changes affecting the caseload reduction credit and the provision of limited TANF assistance are effective on October 1, 2025. </p> <p>TITLE II--SNAP EXEMPTIONS </p> <p>(Sec. 311) This section expands applicability of the work requirements for SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs). (SNAP recipients who are ABAWDs have work-related requirements in addition to the general SNAP work registration and employment and training requirements.) </p> <p>Specifically, this section applies the work requirements for ABAWDs to adults who are</p> <ul> <li>not over 51 years old in FY2023, </li> <li> not over 53 years old in FY2024, and </li> <li> not over 55 years old in FY2025 and every year thereafter. </li> </ul> <p>Under current law, these requirements apply to adults who are not over 50 years old. These provisions go into effect 90 days after enactment and sunset on October 1, 2030. </p> <p>Also, the section exempts from the ABAWD work requirements homeless individuals, veterans, and certain individuals who were previously in foster care and are 24 years old or younger. </p> <p>(Sec. 312) This section prohibits a state agency from accumulating unused exemptions to the ABAWD work requirement and providing them to eligible SNAP recipients beyond the subsequent fiscal year.</p> <p> Currently, for each fiscal year, a state agency may exempt a certain number of SNAP recipients from the ABAWD work requirements; unused exemptions may be carried over and used in a subsequent fiscal year. Under this section, an unused exemption may not be carried over for more than one year. </p> <p>Further, this section reduces the percentage of exemptions a state agency may provide each year so that the average monthly number of exemptions does not exceed 8% of covered individuals (i.e., SNAP recipients and certain individuals who were denied SNAP benefits due to the work requirements). Under current law, a state is eligible for exemptions for up to 12% of covered individuals.</p> <p>These provisions apply to FY2024 and each subsequent fiscal year. </p> <p>(Sec. 313) This section expands the purpose of SNAP to include assisting low-income adults in obtaining employment and increasing their earnings. </p> <p>(Sec. 314) This section requires USDA to make public all available state requests for waivers from the SNAP ABAWD work requirements and the approvals of the requests within 30 days of enactment; this includes making public all supporting data from the state about the request and relevant documentation on the utilization of waivers. </p> <p>This waiver program allows the Food and Nutrition Service to provide a state exemptions from SNAP ABAWD work requirements based on a determination that an area (1) has an unemployment rate of over 10%, or (2) does not have a sufficient number of jobs. </p> <p>TITLE III--PERMITTING REFORM </p> <p>(Sec. 321) This section modifies provisions under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), including by limiting the scope of the administrative review of major federal actions. Under NEPA, agencies must conduct an environmental assessment (EA) to determine if a proposed federal action will have significant environmental impacts. If the EA determines that such impacts will be significant, then the agency must submit an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The EIS must include a range of alternatives to the proposed action. </p> <p>Among other elements, the section defines a<i> major federal action</i> to be an action that an agency determines is subject to substantial federal control and responsibility. The definition explicitly excludes certain actions from NEPA requirements, such as a nonfederal action with minimal federal funding or involvement. </p> <p>This section limits the scope of an EIS review to reasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed agency action. The section also provides threshold determinations for when an agency is not required to prepare an environmental document under NEPA, such as when categorical exclusions (including those adopted from another agency) apply.</p> <p>The section limits alternatives in an EIS to a reasonable range. Further, the alternatives included in the EIS must be technically and economically feasible. Additionally, an EA or EIS must also be under the page limits established by the section. </p> <p>The section also requires a lead agency to be designated when more than one agency is participating in a proposed action. The lead agency must supervise the preparation of one environmental document (e.g., EIS) and prepare a schedule to complete the review of the action. </p> <p>The lead agency must complete the EA or EIS within deadlines established by the section but may extend the deadline to provide additional time as is necessary. Additionally, a project sponsor may file a written petition to seek a court order to set forth a schedule and deadline for the agency if the agency has failed to act. </p> <p>A lead agency must prescribe procedures to allow a project sponsor to prepare an EA or EIS under the supervision of the agency. </p> <p>The section also provides guidelines for the (1) use of analysis from a previously reviewed programmatic environmental document in a subsequent document for a specified time period, and (2) adoption of another agency's categorical exclusions for proposed agency actions. </p> <p>Under this section, the Council on Environmental Quality must study and report on the potential for online and digital technologies to address delays in reviews and improve public accessibility and transparency related to NEPA requirements.</p> <p>(Sec. 322) This section requires the Electric Reliability Organization to study the total transfer capability between transmission planning regions.
