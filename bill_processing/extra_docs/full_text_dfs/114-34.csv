B,Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis ,XI,Compassionate communication on HIPAA,,,11001.,Sense of Congress,"(a) (a) Findings Congress finds the following: (1) (1) According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, in 2015, there were approximately 9,800,000 adults in the United States with serious mental illness. (2) (2) The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration defines the term serious mental illness as an illness affecting individuals 18 years of age or older as having, at any time in the past year, a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder that results in serious functional impairment and substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities. (3) (3) In reporting on the incidence of serious mental illness, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration includes major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other mental disorders that cause serious impairment. (4) (4) Adults with a serious mental illness are at a higher risk for chronic physical illnesses and premature death. (5) (5) According to the World Health Organization, adults with a serious mental illness have lifespans that are 10 to 25 years shorter than those without serious mental illness. The vast majority of these deaths are due to chronic physical medical conditions, such as cardiovascular, respiratory, and infectious diseases, as well as diabetes and hypertension. (6) (6) According to the World Health Organization, the majority of deaths of adults with a serious mental illness that are due to physical medical conditions are preventable. (7) (7) Supported decision making can facilitate care decisions in areas where serious mental illness may impact the capacity of an individual to determine a course of treatment while still allowing the individual to make decisions independently. (8) (8) Help should be provided to adults with a serious mental illness to address their acute or chronic physical illnesses, make informed choices about treatment, and understand and follow through with appropriate treatment. (9) (9) There is confusion in the health care community regarding permissible practices under the regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (commonly known as HIPAA ). This confusion may hinder appropriate communication of health care information or treatment preferences with appropriate caregivers.."
