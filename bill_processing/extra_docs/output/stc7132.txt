    Header: Definitions
    Except as otherwise provided in this Act, terms used in this Act that are defined in section 345(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, as added by section 4 of this Act, have the meanings given those terms in such section 345(a).

    Header: Findings
    Congress finds the following:
      (1)
      Domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, sexual assault, human trafficking, and related crimes are life-threatening issues and have lasting and harmful effects on individuals, families, and entire communities.
      (2)
      Survivors often lack meaningful support and options when establishing independence from an abuser, including barriers such as financial insecurity and limited access to reliable communications tools to maintain essential connections with family, social safety networks, employers, and support services.
      (3)
      Perpetrators of violence and abuse described in paragraph (1) increasingly use technological and communications tools to exercise control over, monitor, and abuse their victims.
      (4)
      Communications law can play a public interest role in the promotion of safety, life, and property with respect to the types of violence and abuse described in paragraph (1). For example, independent access to a wireless phone plan can assist survivors in establishing security and autonomy.
      (5)
      Safeguards within communications services can serve a role in preventing abuse and narrowing the digital divide experienced by survivors of abuse.
