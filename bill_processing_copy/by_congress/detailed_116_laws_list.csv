However, it does not define FGM.</p> <p>In 2018 a federal district court invalidated the FGM statute in <em>United States vs. Nagarwala</em>. The court found, among other things, that the statute exceeds Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution because it (1) lacks detailed, record-based findings regarding how FGM substantially affects interstate commerce; and (2) lacks jurisdictional elements (e.g., requirements that charged offenses have an explicit connection with, or effect on, interstate commerce). In 2019, the Department of Justice (DOJ) decided not to appeal the decision.</p> <p>This bill creates a statutory definition of <em>female genital mutilation </em>and provides explicit findings regarding the effects of FGM on interstate commerce. </p> <p>The bill broadens the scope of prohibited FGM-related conduct on a minor to include</p> <ul> <li>attempting or conspiring to perform FGM;</li> <li>facilitating or consenting to FGM, as a parent, guardian, or caretaker; and</li> <li>transporting a minor for FGM.</li> </ul> <p>It expressly requires prohibited FGM-related conduct to have a connection to interstate or foreign commerce. </p> <p>The bill increases from 5 to 10 years the statutory maximum prison term for an FGM offense. It also prohibits a federal criminal defendant from asserting, as a defense, that FGM is required as a matter of religion, custom, tradition, ritual, or standard practice.</p> <p>DOJ, in consultation with various federal agencies, must report annually on FGM, including the estimated number of women and girls at risk of or subjected to FGM and actions taken by government agencies to combat the practice.</p> <p>Finally, the bill expresses the sense of Congress that the court erred in invalidating the existing statute. It expresses, among other sentiments, that Congress elects to amend the statute to clarify the commercial nature of FGM, but that Congress does not ratify the interpretation of the federal district court in <em>Nagarwala</em>.</p>","['Judiciary Committee', 'Judiciary Committee']","['Congressional oversight', 'Crimes against children', 'Crimes against women', 'Criminal procedure and sentencing', 'Judicial procedure and administration', 'Sex offenses', ""Women's health""]","https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/116/hr/3583?format=xml, https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/116/s/2017?format=xml","Rep.

The trustee must assist in developing a reorganization plan, account for the property of the debtor, attend certain hearings and conferences, and ensure that the debtor complies with payments required under the plan. </p> <p>As under current law, a debtor may operate their business as a debtor in possession during the reorganization. The bill sets forth the rights and powers of a debtor in possession, as well as the procedures for removing a debtor in possession.</p> <p>The bill provides reporting requirements for debtors and reduces the amount of disclosures required by debtors under current law.</p> <p>Under these new procedures, only a debtor is allowed to file a reorganization plan. Currently, creditors may also submit plans for court approval for small businesses filing under Chapter 11.</p> <p>The bill sets forth requirements regarding the filing and contents of a plan of reorganization. A debtor must submit all or a portion of future income to the trustee as needed to execute the plan.</p> <p> The bill provides authority to the bankruptcy court to approve a reorganization plan for small businesses over the objections of the creditors. However, the plan may not discriminate unfairly, and must be fair and equitable towards each class of claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan. Currently, creditors must generally vote to approve such a plan. Under a fair and equitable plan as established by this bill, a debtor's projected disposable income for at least three years, but no longer than five, must go towards payments under the plan. </p> <p>(Sec. 3) The bill also provides additional standards a trustee must meet in order to void a preferential transfer for all Chapter 11 filers. (Preferential transfers generally occur when a debtor transfers property before filing bankruptcy that is beneficial to one creditor to the detriment of others.) Specifically, a trustee may only void such a transfer based on reasonable due diligence and must take into account a party's known or reasonably knowable affirmative defenses. </p> <p>The bill also revises venue criteria for proceedings connected with a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. Currently, an action to recover a debt against a noninsider (i.e., those that are not relatives, general partners, and directors or officers of the debtor) of less than $13,650 must be brought in the district court where the defendant resides. The bill increases that amount to $25,000. </p> <p>(Sec. 5) This bill takes effect 180 days after enactment. </p>","['Judiciary Committee', 'Administrative State, Regulatory Reform, and Antitrust Subcommittee']","['Bankruptcy', 'Corporate finance and management', 'Jurisdiction and venue', 'Small business']",https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/116/s/1091?format=xml,"Rep.
