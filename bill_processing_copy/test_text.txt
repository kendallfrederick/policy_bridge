Climate change attribution is the study of whether, or to what degree, human influence may have 
contributed to extreme climate or weather events.  
Advances in the science of climate attribution now allow scientists to make estimates of the 
human contribution to such events.1 Understanding the attribution process and its uncertainties 
may be helpful to policymakers, organizations, and individuals in evaluating and weighing these 
estimates, and in considering how to prioritize and manage associated risks. 
A key area of climate research has been the effort to attribute observed changes in the climate to 
natural and human-related factors.2 A scientific consensus has emerged that the increase in 
concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere is the result of human actions such 
as the emissions of GHGs from the burning of fossil fuels and land management and that these 
emissions are influencing the climate.3 This influence has been confirmed with increasing 
confidence for many global and regional climate processes.4  
By the early years of the 21st century there was broad acceptance in the scientific community that 
some global trends in the climate, such as increases in global average temperature since the mid-
20th century, could be attributed to human action with some degree of confidence.5 However, 
existing methods could not determine whether a specific weather event, such as a heat wave or a 
severe storm, could be linked to human-induced climate change.6 In 2003, a scientist proposed to 
statistically test whether changes in extreme event probability could be attributed to human 
influence.7 Since that time, scientists have developed a variety of methods to investigate human 
influence on extreme weather or climate events.8 
 
1 The U.S. Department of Agriculture on its “Climate Hubs: Extreme Weather” website 
(https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/node/1476/) distinguishes weather and climate extreme events:  
Extreme events are occurrences of unusually severe weather or climate conditions that can cause 
devastating impacts on communities and agricultural and natural ecosystems. Weather-related 
extreme events are often short-lived and include heat waves, freezes, heavy downpours, tornadoes, 
tropical cyclones and floods. Climate-related extreme events either persist longer than weather 
events or emerge from the accumulation of weather or climate events that persist over a longer 
period of time. Examples include drought resulting from long periods of below-normal 
precipitation or wildfire outbreaks when a prolonged dry, warm period follows an abnormally wet 
and productive growing season.

the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014, defines greenhouse gases as 
“those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at 
specific wavelengths within the spectrum of terrestrial radiation emitted by the earth’s surface, the atmosphere itself, 
and by clouds. This property causes the greenhouse effect.”
