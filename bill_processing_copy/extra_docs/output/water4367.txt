                (i)
                the indemnification clause, which was first applied in 1910 to flood control projects, should still be included in project partnership agreements prepared by the Corps of Engineers for water resources development projects; and
                (ii)

            Judge Murphy served five consecutive terms before stepping down in 1961 to focus on practicing law;
            (6)
            in 1971, Judge Murphy was appointed by Governor Jimmy Carter to the Superior Court for the Tallapoosa Judicial Circuit, and following his election in 1976, President Carter nominated Judge Murphy to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia;
            (7)
            Judge Murphy was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 28, 1977;
            (8)
            for 45 years, Judge Murphy served his country on the Federal bench and became an acclaimed jurist and legal icon with a stellar reputation that extended far beyond Georgia;
            (9)
            Judge Murphy always displayed a quick wit and a keen sense of humor, was kind and empathetic, and treated all those who appeared before him with courtesy and respect;

            (14)
            above all else, Judge Murphy was a loving and devoted husband and father—and a strong role model.
