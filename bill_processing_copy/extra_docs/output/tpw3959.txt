        Header: In general
        Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall take such actions as are necessary, including issuance of an interim final rule if needed, to streamline the procedures for individuals applying for or renewing enrollment in more than one TSA security threat assessment program, in particular, the TWIC and HAZMAT Endorsement programs, and any other credentialing programs as determined by the Administrator, by—
          (A)
          permitting an individual to enroll at any TSA authorized enrollment center once for a threat assessment program endorsement and use the application, including associated biometric and biographic data, as well as information generated by TSA’s vetting, for one of such programs to enroll in any other of such programs;
          (B)
          permitting an individual to visit any TSA authorized enrollment center and enroll in more than one TSA security threat assessment program at the same time for a fee that is less than the cumulative fee that would otherwise be incurred for each such program separately;
          (C)
          permitting an individual to undergo a streamlined and expeditious renewal process;
          (D)
          aligning the expiration of an individual’s successful, valid eligibility determination with the expiration of that individual’s eligibility to participate in subsequent TSA security threat assessment programs to which the individual applies;
          (E)
          providing to States the expiration dates for each individual’s TSA security threat assessment to ensure a commercial driver’s license of an individual who holds a HAZMAT Endorsement does not indicate the individual is authorized to transport hazardous materials after the expiration date of the enrollment of the individual in the HAZMAT Endorsement security threat assessment program if such commercial driver’s license has an expiration date that is different from the expiration date of such enrollment; and
          (F)
          enrolling an individual in a subsequent TSA security threat assessment program at the minimum cost necessary for the TSA to cover printing, issuance, and case management costs, costs associated with the collection of any additional biometric and biographic data in accordance with paragraph (3), and other costs that are not duplicative.
