                (A)
                while significant progress has occurred due to the establishment of the disadvantaged business enterprise program, discrimination and related barriers continue to pose significant obstacles for minority- and women-owned businesses seeking to do business in Federally assisted surface transportation markets across the United States;
                (B)
                the continuing barriers described in subparagraph (A) merit the continuation of the disadvantaged business enterprise program;
                (C)
                Congress has received and reviewed testimony and documentation of race and gender discrimination from numerous sources, including congressional hearings and roundtables, scientific reports, reports issued by public and private agencies, news stories, reports of discrimination by organizations and individuals, and discrimination lawsuits, which show that race- and gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient to address the problem;
                (D)
                the testimony and documentation described in subparagraph (C) demonstrate that discrimination across the United States poses a barrier to full and fair participation in surface transportation-related businesses of women business owners and minority business owners and has impacted firm development and many aspects of surface transportation-related business in the public and private markets; and
                (E)
                the testimony and documentation described in subparagraph (C) provide a strong basis that there is a compelling need for the continuation of the disadvantaged business enterprise program to address race and gender discrimination in surface transportation-related business.

                Recognizing the benefits that will accrue to the State of Alaska and to the United States from the reconstruction of the Alaska Highway from the Alaskan border at Beaver Creek, Yukon Territory, to Haines Junction in Canada and the Haines Cutoff Highway from Haines Junction in Canada to Haines, Alaska, the Secretary may provide for the necessary reconstruction of the highway using funds awarded through an applicable competitive grant program, if the highway meets all applicable eligibility requirements for the program, except for the specific requirements established by the agreement for the Alaska Highway Project between the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada. In addition to the funds described in the previous sentence, notwithstanding any other provision of law and on agreement with the State of Alaska, the Secretary is authorized to expend on such highway or the Alaska Marine Highway System any Federal-aid highway funds apportioned to the State of Alaska under this title at a Federal share of 100 per centum. No expenditures shall be made for the construction of the portion of such highways that are in Canada unless an agreement is in place between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States (including an agreement in existence on the date of enactment of the
                  Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act of 2021

                  will not impose any highway toll, or permit any such toll to be charged for the use of such highways by vehicles or persons;
                  (3)
                  will not levy or assess, directly or indirectly, any fee, tax, or other charge for the use of such highways by vehicles or persons from the United States that does not apply equally to vehicles or persons of Canada;
                  (4)
                  will continue to grant reciprocal recognition of vehicle registration and driver's licenses in accordance with agreements between the United States and Canada; and
                  (5)
                  will maintain such highways after their completion in proper condition adequately to serve the needs of present and future traffic.

          Header: Findings
          Congress finds that—
            (1)
            the industrial sector is integral to the economy of the United States—
              (A)
              providing millions of jobs and essential products; and
              (B)
              demonstrating global leadership in manufacturing and innovation;
            (2)
            carbon capture and storage technologies are necessary for reducing hard-to-abate emissions from the industrial sector, which emits nearly 25 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States;
            (3)
            carbon removal and storage technologies, including direct air capture, must be deployed at large-scale in the coming decades to remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere;
            (4)
            large-scale deployment of carbon capture, removal, utilization, transport, and storage—
              (A)
              is critical for achieving mid-century climate goals; and
              (B)
              will drive regional economic development, technological innovation, and high-wage employment;
            (5)
            carbon capture, removal, and utilization technologies require a backbone system of shared carbon dioxide transport and storage infrastructure to enable large-scale deployment, realize economies of scale, and create an interconnected carbon management market;
            (6)
            carbon dioxide transport infrastructure and permanent geological storage are proven and safe technologies with existing Federal and State regulatory frameworks;
            (7)
            carbon dioxide transport and storage infrastructure share similar barriers to deployment previously faced by other types of critical national infrastructure, such as high capital costs and chicken-and-egg challenges, that require Federal and State support, in combination with private investment, to be overcome; and
            (8)
            each State should take into consideration, with respect to new carbon dioxide transportation infrastructure—
              (A)
              qualifying the infrastructure as pollution control devices under applicable laws (including regulations) of the State; and
              (B)
              establishing a waiver of ad valorem and property taxes for the infrastructure for a period of not less than 10 years.

        Header: Findings
        Congress finds the following:
          (1)
          Access to affordable, reliable, high-speed broadband is essential to full participation in modern life in the United States.
          (2)
          The persistent
            digital divide
          in the United States is a barrier to the economic competitiveness of the United States and equitable distribution of essential public services, including health care and education.
          (3)
          The digital divide disproportionately affects communities of color, lower-income areas, and rural areas, and the benefits of broadband should be broadly enjoyed by all.
          (4)
          In many communities across the country, increased competition among broadband providers has the potential to offer consumers more affordable, high-quality options for broadband service.
          (5)
          The 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic has underscored the critical importance of affordable, high-speed broadband for individuals, families, and communities to be able to work, learn, and connect remotely while supporting social distancing.

            Header: Findings
            Congress finds that—
              (1)
              the United States must make significant investments to install, upgrade, or replace the public works infrastructure of the United States;
              (2)
              with respect to investments in the infrastructure of the United States, taxpayers expect that their public works infrastructure will be produced in the United States by American workers;
              (3)
              United States taxpayer dollars invested in public infrastructure should not be used to reward companies that have moved their operations, investment dollars, and jobs to foreign countries or foreign factories, particularly those that do not share or openly flout the commitments of the United States to environmental, worker, and workplace safety protections;
              (4)
              in procuring materials for public works projects, entities using taxpayer-financed Federal assistance should give a commonsense procurement preference for the materials and products produced by companies and workers in the United States in accordance with the high ideals embodied in the environmental, worker, workplace safety, and other regulatory requirements of the United States;
              (5)
              common construction materials used in public works infrastructure projects, including steel, iron, manufactured products, non-ferrous metals, plastic and polymer-based products (including polyvinylchloride, composite building materials, and polymers used in fiber optic cables), glass (including optic glass), lumber, and drywall are not adequately covered by a domestic content procurement preference, thus limiting the impact of taxpayer purchases to enhance supply chains in the United States;
              (6)
              the benefits of domestic content procurement preferences extend beyond economics;
              (7)
              by incentivizing domestic manufacturing, domestic content procurement preferences reinvest tax dollars in companies and processes using the highest labor and environmental standards in the world;
              (8)
              strong domestic content procurement preference policies act to prevent shifts in production to countries that rely on production practices that are significantly less energy efficient and far more polluting than those in the United States;
              (9)
              for over 75 years, Buy America and other domestic content procurement preference laws have been part of the United States procurement policy, ensuring that the United States can build and rebuild the infrastructure of the United States with high-quality American-made materials;
              (10)
              before the date of enactment of this Act, a domestic content procurement preference requirement may not apply, may apply only to a narrow scope of products and materials, or may be limited by waiver with respect to many infrastructure programs, which necessitates a review of such programs, including programs for roads, highways, and bridges, public transportation, dams, ports, harbors, and other maritime facilities, intercity passenger and freight railroads, freight and intermodal facilities, airports, water systems, including drinking water and wastewater systems, electrical transmission facilities and systems, utilities, broadband infrastructure, and buildings and real property;
              (11)
              Buy America laws create demand for domestically produced goods, helping to sustain and grow domestic manufacturing and the millions of jobs domestic manufacturing supports throughout product supply chains;
              (12)
              as of the date of enactment of this Act, domestic content procurement preference policies apply to all Federal Government procurement and to various Federal-aid infrastructure programs;
              (13)
              a robust domestic manufacturing sector is a vital component of the national security of the United States;
              (14)
              as more manufacturing operations of the United States have moved offshore, the strength and readiness of the defense industrial base of the United States has been diminished; and
              (15)
              domestic content procurement preference laws—
                (A)
                are fully consistent with the international obligations of the United States; and
                (B)
                together with the government procurements to which the laws apply, are important levers for ensuring that United States manufacturers can access the government procurement markets of the trading partners of the United States.

          Header: Findings
          Congress makes the following findings:
            (1)
            The COVID–19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of the United States supply chains for, and lack of domestic production of, personal protective equipment (PPE).
            (2)
            The United States requires a robust, secure, and wholly domestic PPE supply chain to safeguard public health and national security.
            (3)
            Issuing a strategy that provides the government’s anticipated needs over the next three years will enable suppliers to assess what changes, if any, are needed in their manufacturing capacity to meet expected demands.
            (4)
            In order to foster a domestic PPE supply chain, United States industry needs a strong and consistent demand signal from the Federal Government providing the necessary certainty to expand production capacity investment in the United States.
            (5)
            In order to effectively incentivize investment in the United States and the re-shoring of manufacturing, long-term contracts must be no shorter than three years in duration.
            (6)
            To accomplish this aim, the United States should seek to ensure compliance with its international obligations, such as its commitments under the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Government Procurement and its free trade agreements, including by invoking any relevant exceptions to those agreements, especially those related to national security and public health.
            (7)
            The United States needs a long-term investment strategy for the domestic production of PPE items critical to the United States national response to a public health crisis, including the COVID–19 pandemic.

      Header: Findings regarding unused unemployment insurance funds
      Congress finds the following:
        (1)
        On July 16, 2021, the Congressional Budget Office (in this section referred to as
          CBO
        ) reduced its projected cost of the extension of expanded unemployment compensation as enacted in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (P.L. 117–2).
        (2)
        CBO budget projections included mandatory outlays for the expansion totaling $144,000,000,000 in 2021 and $8,000,000,000 in 2022. That estimated cost is $50,000,000,000 less in 2021, and $3,000,000,000 less in 2022, than anticipated in CBO's March 2021 cost estimate.
        (3)
        CBO reduced its projections of those costs for two major reasons. First, several States have announced that they are discontinuing one or more of the components of expanded unemployment compensation before the expansion’s authorization ends in September 2021. In its original estimate, CBO projected that all States would participate in the programs until September. Second, because of the improving economy, the agency has lowered its forecast of the unemployment rate, resulting in fewer projected beneficiaries for the programs, which also reduced projected costs.
        (4)
        It is estimated that there are approximately $53,000,000,000 in savings from the amounts in the Treasury originally estimated to be spent on unemployment insurance funds (under the provisions of subtitle A of title II of division A of the CARES Act) not used by the States.
