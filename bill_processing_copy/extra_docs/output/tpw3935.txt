        (1)
        the Administrator should—
          (A)
          engage with aviation stakeholder groups and the public during pre-drafting stages of rulemaking activities and use, to the greatest extent practicable, properly docketed ex parte discussions during rulemaking activities in order to—
            (i)
            inform the work of the Administrator;
            (ii)
            assist the Administrator in developing the scope of a rule; and
            (iii)
            reduce the timeline for issuance of proposed and final rules;
          (B)
          rely on documented data and safety trends when determining whether or not to proceed with a rulemaking activity; and
          (C)
          not consider a rulemaking activity required in statute, for the purposes of ex parte communications, as having been established on the date of enactment of the related public law, but rather upon obtainment of a regulation identifier number; and
        (2)
        when it would reduce the time required for the Administrator to adjudicate public comments, the Administrator should publicly provide information describing the rationale behind a regulatory decision included in proposed regulations in order to better allow for the public to provide clear and informed comments on such regulations.

        Header: Findings
        Congress finds the following:
          (1)
          Congress has tasked the FAA with responsibility for securing the national airspace system, including the air traffic control system and other air navigation services, civil aircraft, and aeronautical products and articles through safety regulation and oversight. These mandates have included protecting against cyber threats affecting aviation safety or the Administration’s provision of safe, secure, and efficient air navigation services and airspace management.
          (2)
          In 2016, Congress passed the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016, pursuant to which the FAA enhanced the cybersecurity of the national airspace system by—
            (A)
            developing a cybersecurity strategic plan;
            (B)
            coordinating with other Federal agencies to identify cyber vulnerabilities;
            (C)
            developing a cyber threat model; and
            (D)
            completing a comprehensive, strategic policy framework to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks to the air traffic control system.
          (3)
          In 2018, Congress passed the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 which—
            (A)
            authorized funding for the construction of FAA facilities dedicated to improving the cybersecurity of the national airspace system;
            (B)
            required the FAA to review and update its comprehensive, strategic policy framework for cybersecurity to assess the degree to which the framework identifies and addresses known cybersecurity risks associated with the aviation system, and evaluate existing short- and long-term objectives for addressing cybersecurity risks to the national airspace system;
            (C)
            created a Chief Technology Officer position within the FAA to be responsible for, among other things, coordinating the implementation, operation, maintenance, and cybersecurity of technology programs relating to the air traffic control system with the aviation industry and other Federal agencies; and
            (D)
            directed the National Academy of Sciences to study the cybersecurity workforce of the FAA in order to develop recommendations to increase the size, quality, and diversity of such workforce.
          (4)
          Congress has declared that the FAA is the primary Federal agency to assess and address the threats posed from cyber incidents relating to FAA-provided air traffic control and air navigation services and the threats posed from cyber incidents relating to civil aircraft, aeronautical products and articles, aviation networks, aviation systems, services, and operations, and the aerospace industry affecting aviation safety or the provision of safe, secure, and efficient air navigation services and airspace management by the Administration.

        Header: Minority and disadvantaged business participation
          (a)
          Header: Findings
          Congress finds the following:
            (1)
            While significant progress has occurred due to the establishment of the airport disadvantaged business enterprise program and the airport concessions disadvantaged business enterprise program under sections 47113 and 47107(e) of title 49, United States Code, respectively, discrimination and related barriers continue to pose significant obstacles for minority- and women-owned businesses seeking to do business in airport-related markets across the Nation.
            (2)
            Congress has received and reviewed testimony and documentation of race and gender discrimination from numerous sources, including congressional hearings and roundtables, scientific reports, reports issued by public and private agencies, news stories, reports of discrimination by organizations and individuals, and discrimination lawsuits. Such testimony and documentation show that race- and gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient to address the problem.
            (3)
            The testimony and documentation described in paragraph (2) demonstrate that race and gender discrimination pose a barrier to full and fair participation in airport-related businesses of women business owners and minority business owners in the racial groups detailed in parts 23 and 26 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, and has impacted firm development and other aspects of airport-related business in the public and private markets.
            (4)
            The testimony and documentation described in paragraph (2) provide a strong basis that there is a compelling need for the continuation of the airport disadvantaged business enterprise program and the airport concessions disadvantaged business enterprise program to address race and gender discrimination in airport-related business.
          (b)
          Header: Supportive services
          Section 47113 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:
